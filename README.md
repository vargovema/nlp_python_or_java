# Classifying Stack Overflow posts using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing

## Description

The goal of this tasks is to train a machine learning classifier to distinguish between questions tagged *python* and *java* using the text of the question. The resulting classifier represents a first step towards a system that can automatically categorize new incoming posts. The data cosists of random sample of 1000 posts tagged python and 1000 posts tagged java.

The final model trained based on the sample data achieved 90% accuracy. For more details on the model, see the Jupyter Notebook NLP+classification.ipynb.
