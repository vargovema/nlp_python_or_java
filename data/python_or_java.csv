I have one model, which is a table of URLs that can be submitted to my app.  I also, through a many to many relationship, have made the ability to combine the URLs into 'collections'.  This works just fine however, I would like to add the ability to order and reorder the links in a collection.  So for example, the list of links id [a,b,c,d].  User1 creates a collection of [d,a,c], while User2 creates a collection of [a,c,d], and User3 creates a collection of [c,d,b].

Setup: PyCharm 5.0.2 + anaconda 2.7.11-0

Limitations: My preference would be to use a Mac, but my work requires me to use a Windows machine. I am familiar with the unix/linux terminals but unfamiliar with the windows command prompt. 

Problem: I would like to open multiple webpages that use a Bing (or Google) search on a list of keywords. (I have entered into a new field and need to look up a hundreds of unknown terms. I am too lazy to manually do the search for each term.) 

My attempts:

<ol>
<li>I have not been successful in finding an application that does Bing or Google searches in batch mode. Thus, I have decided to write my own script. </li>
<li>I recalled seeing that webpages could be rendered directly in the juter with the HTML() from IPython.display:

<pre><code># import modules
from IPython.display import HTML

# create the list of keywords
keys = ['grum+cat','garfield+cat','basement+cat']

# loop through each key and display the search webpage
for k in keys:
    HTML('&lt;iframe src=https://www.google.com/search?q='+k+' width=700 height=350&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;') 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

Alas, nothing happens. I did check this:

<pre><code>HTML('&lt;iframe src=https://www.google.com/search?q='+k[0]+' width=700 height=350&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;') 
</code></pre>

And that seems to be fine, but I need automation.

<ol start=""3"">
<li>I moved on to a combination of input file,  command generating script, and batch script (to run in command prompt, which would be equivalent to a shell script like bash or tcsh). </li>
</ol>

Contents of 'search_list.txt':

<pre><code>grum+cat
garfield+cat
basement+cat
</code></pre>

Contents of 'batch_search.':

<pre><code># Do a batch bing search in firefox using a keyword search list

# Make import statements
import num as np

# Read in the data
keys = np.loadtxt(""search_list.txt"", dtype='str')

# Output to a batch file
f1=open('./batch_search.bat', 'w+')
for k in keys:
    command = ""start firefox http://www.bing.com/search?q=""+s+""\r\n""
    f1.write(command)

# Why doesn't this line work?
#%%!batch_search.bat
</code></pre>

Contents of 'run_batch_search.bat':

<pre><code>i batch_search.

batch_search.bat
</code></pre>

Finally, run in command prompt using:

<pre><code>run_batch_search.bat
</code></pre>

What now?:

The above does open multiple tabs in firefox pointed to the bing search results for the inputed keywords, but I would like this to be a bit more streamlined. 

Ideally, I would be able to (most preferably) open the web browsers pointed to the google/bing search directly from the  script. Solutions?

Otherwise, how can I properly format the last line of 'batch_search.' to get the call to the command prompt to work?

More Information for @Kris (see comments below): The main goal is to look up via web searches hundreds of unknown terms for self education. For example, if I look up <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=garfield%20cat"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=garfield+cat</a> in firefox, the wikipedia results for Garfield cat pops up in the right-hand column of the page. If for one of my own search terms, the Bing popup results appear to be accurate, then I retain that as my reference information and I move on to the results for the next keyword. If it does not appear to be a good match, then I must continue to read the search results and follow links until I find an appropriate match.

8,7136200,"So I'm having a little trouble dealing with for loops in Python - as far as I can tell, they're getting slower with time. I'm looping over a range inside of a range, and as time passes, the loop noticeably slows. This is done inside of a game engine, if it matters. Could anyone tell me what the issue is?

Here's a quick example.

<pre><code>for x in range(xs): # xs, ys, and zs are all pre-determined size values

     for z in range(zs):

          for y in range(ys):

              vp = [x * vs, y * vs, z * vs]

              v = Cube(vp)
</code></pre>

The initial speed of this process is fine, but with time the loop slows. I know it's not anything else like the Rasterizer of the game engine because when the loop is done, the rest of the engine runs at 60 FPS. So what could be the problem?

EDIT: I'm using Python 3, so there is no xrange.

EDIT 2: For this example, vs is 1.0, and the predetermined size values of xs, ys, and zs are all 20.

14,36396220,"I have a simple code to group and calculate content of the list. I'm concerned of the time it takes to complete the job. With less than 100 items it is fast enough, but several hundreds items make my Mac to scream. And I have up to 10000 items on a list from real world data. So I need to know, how it is possible to optimize this code:

<pre><code>v = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
v1 = v[:5]
l = len(v1)
a = [sum(v1[x:y]) for y in range(l+1) for x in range(y)]
d = {x:a.count(x) for x in a}
</code></pre>

So on <em>v</em> there is a list of integers. Digit can be from 1 to 4000. List length on example is 10, but as stated above, it will go go to 10000. <em>v1</em> is just a split list to work with a smaller test data.

<em>a</em> gets every item as a single instance AND all preceding items as instances:

<pre><code>[1, 3, 2, 6, 5, 3, 10, 9, 7, 4, 15, 14, 12, 9, 5]
</code></pre>

<em>d</em> groups all items and counts them as a key value pair dictionary:

<pre><code>{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 1, 7: 1, 9: 2, 10: 1, 12: 1, 14: 1, 15: 1}
</code></pre>

It seems that calculating <em>a</em> already becomes very heavy after 100+ items. With 500 items on <em>a</em> I get 276813 instances for <em>d</em>. So when there will be 10000 items on a list, I'm expecting up to 5559333 items to be on <em>d</em> and maybe 100 times more on <em>a</em>.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>

Based on comments and answers below there is some improvement done via implementation below:

<pre><code>def t5(v1):
    l = len(v1)
    d = {}
    for x in range(0, l):
       s = sum(v1[x:])
       if s in d:
          d[s] += 1
       else:
          d[s] = 1
       for y in range(1, l-x):
           s -= v1[-y]

           else:

Had to re-write the question due to changed requirements.

I have a dictionary such as the following:

And those with the greatest value(the sum of the integers in each list) should return

I have tried

<pre><code>min_value = min(dict.itervalues())

Thank you for your input!

<strong>EDIT:</strong> First, apologies for the confusion caused. Perhaps I thought of the problem as being simpler than I thought and gave less information than required. I will delve deeper, the input file i am using is of the form:

<pre><code># MENU TYPE     NAME            PRIV?   DESCRIPTION
DEFINE_MENU     CRAGINS
MENU            menu_name1              This takes you to menu 1
MENU            menu_name2              This takes you to menu 2
VARIABLE        var_name1               Alter variable1
VARIABLE        var_name2       PRIV    Alter variable1
COMMAND         command1                Perform command1
DEFINE_MENU     MENU2
MENU            menu_name3              This takes you to menu 3
MENU            menu_name4              This takes you to menu 4
VARIABLE        var_name3               Alter variable3
VARIABLE        var_name4       PRIV    Alter variable4
COMMAND         command3                Perform command3
</code></pre>

I had raised the flag as I further manipulate the data between the <code>DEFINE_MENU</code> calls. I have edited the code to include the full method that I have written. 

The outcome is currently a dictionary where the key is the menu title and value is the another dictionary containing the menu items (values following the title) as follows:

<pre><code>{'title1': {'1': 'menu_name1', '3': 'var_name1', '2': 'menu_name2', '5': 'command1', '4': 'var_name2'}}
</code></pre>

What I would like to have is a larger dictionary containing the menu titles as keys with the lowest level dictionary as the value. I understand that this is complicated so I'm sorry if it unclear, let me know if more information is required.

Thanks again

Where it does <em>not</em> work is reading SQA object value into this widget in the form, like <code>form = form_class(request.POST, sqa_item_instance)</code>, where <code>sqa_item_instance</code> has been read from SQLAlchemy and has a bool field.

How can I get that, that is, ""populate"" form <code>SelectYesNo</code> field correctly from SQA item?

33,4936620,"I recently learned about <a href=""http://docs.sci.org/doc/num/reference/generated/num.ndarray.strides.html"">strides</a> in the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4923617/efficient-num-2d-array-construction-from-1d-array"">answer to this post</a>, and was wondering how I could use them to compute a moving average filter more efficiently than what I proposed in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4829738/speed-up-a-program-that-calculate-the-average-of-the-neighbors-in-a-huge-array/4830102#4830102"">this post</a> (using convolution filters).

This is what I have so far. It takes a view of the original array then rolls it by the necessary amount and sums the kernel values to compute the average. I am aware that the edges are not handled correctly, but I can take care of that afterward... Is there a better and faster way? The objective is to filter large floating point arrays up to 5000x5000 x 16 layers in size, a task that <code>sci.ndimage.filters.convolve</code> is fairly slow at.

Note that I am looking for 8-neighbour connectivity, that is a 3x3 filter takes the average of 9 pixels (8 around the focal pixel) and assigns that value to the pixel in the new image.

<pre><code>import num, sci

filtsize = 3
a = num.arange(100).reshape((10,10))
b = num.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided(a, shape=(a.size,filtsize), strides=(a.itemsize, a.itemsize))
for i in range(0, filtsize-1):
    if i &gt; 0:
        b += num.roll(b, -(pow(filtsize,2)+1)*i, 0)
filtered = (num.sum(b, 1) / pow(filtsize,2)).reshape((a.shape[0],a.shape[1]))
sci.misc.imsave(""average.jpg"", filtered)
</code></pre>

EDIT Clarification on how I see this working:

Current code:

<ol>
<li>use stride_tricks to generate an array like [[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[2,3,4]...] which corresponds to the top row of the filter kernel.</li>
<li>Roll along the vertical axis to get the middle row of the kernel [[10,11,12],[11,12,13],[13,14,15]...] and add it to the array I got in 1)</li>
<li>Repeat to get the bottom row of the kernel [[20,21,22],[21,22,23],[22,23,24]...]. At this point, I take the sum of each row and divide it by the number of elements in the filter, giving me the average for each pixel, (shifted by 1 row and 1 col, and with some oddities around edges, but I can take care of that later).</li>
</ol>

What I was hoping for is a better use of stride_tricks to get the 9 values or the sum of the kernel elements directly, for the entire array, or that someone can convince me of another more efficient method...

5.0 0.0

<pre><code>l_tmpCsv_st = pd.read_csv(l_listElement_tc, sep='\t', index_col=0)
l_listOfCsvFiles_tst.append(l_tmpCsv_st)
# Fills in nan cells with the value ""missing"" to distinguish betweens a true nan and a missing value due to lacking padding

# Concatenating csv file with previous ones
csvFusion = pd.concat([csvFusion, l_listOfCsvFiles_tst[-1]], axis=1)
</code></pre>

And after the loop:

<pre><code># Padding missing values of lower frequency files
csvFusion = csvFusion.fillna(method='pad')
# Determinating which columns need to be deleted (all ""Unnamed"" columns are panda-error results and need to be removed)
l_listColumnsToDelete_tst = [col for col in csvFusion.columns if 'Unnamed' in col]
# Dropping these columns
csvFusion.drop(l_listColumnsToDelete_tst, axis=1, inplace=True)
# Writing full stuff to file
csvFusion.to_csv(l_endFile_tc, sep='\t', decimal=',', na_rep='-')

The rest of my script is unrelated to pandas and would only harm readability, thus I have removed it from my co/paste.

How could I avoid this issue?

The main() function is where the two picture objects will be created. I want it to allow the user to select an input picture (the picture to be manipulated) then allow the user to select the vignette (vignette_profile.jpg). Once these two picture objects are created, it should then call addVignette(inputPic, vignette).

The addVignette(inputPic, vignette) function should be written to accept two picture objects as parameters. These picture objects were created in the main() function and passed as input to this function. So basically, using the two picture objects, I need my function to perform the vignette addition operation and this operation should be applied against every pixel within the inputPic picture. The newly edited picture should be displayed to the screen.

61,27113720,"<h1>The Problem</h1>

I'm trying to test a system that uses UDP packets to communicate at a predetermined rate. I want to be able to test this system using a Python test harness with a set packet rate. Sample rates might be 20 packets/sec, or 4500 packets/sec, etc.

In some simple tests I've determined that my Windows machine can pass upwards of 150,000 UDP packets per second over localhost, so I can treat that as an upper limit for the sake of the experiment.

Let's start with this shell structure to create a rate limiter. This code is inspired mostly by code in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/667508/whats-a-good-rate-limiting-algorithm"">this thread</a>.

<h2>Approach 1</h2>

<pre><code>import time, timeit

class RateLimiter:

    def __init__(self, rate_limit):
        self.min_interval = 1.0 / float(rate_limit)
        self.last_time_called = None

    def execute(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
        if self.last_time_called is not None:
            # Sleep until we should wake up
            while True:
                now = timeit.default_timer()
                elapsed = now - self.last_time_called
                left_to_wait = self.min_interval - elapsed

                if left_to_wait &lt;= 0:
                    break

                time.sleep(left_to_wait)

        self.last_time_called = timeit.default_timer()
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

You can use this helper class like so:

<pre><code>self._limiter = RateLimiter(4500)   # 4500 executions/sec

while True:
    self._limiter.execute(do_stuff, param1, param2)
</code></pre>

The call to <code>timeit.default_timer()</code> is a shortcut in Python that gives you the highest accuracy timer for your platform, lending an accuracy of about 1e-6 seconds on both Windows and Linux, which we will need.

<h3>Performance of Approach 1</h3>

In this approach, <code>sleep()</code> can buy you time without eating CPU cycles, but it can hurt the accuracy of your delay. <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/15967564/31707"">This comment</a> shows the differences between Windows and Linux regarding <code>sleep()</code> for periods less than 10ms. In summary of that comment, Windows' <code>sleep()</code> only works for values of 1ms or more (any less is regarded as zero) but generally sleeps for <em>less</em> than the requested sleep time, while in Linux <code>sleep()</code> is more precise but generally sleeps for slightly <em>more</em> than the requested time.

The code above is accurate on my Windows machine, but is inefficient for faster rates. When I requested a rate of 4500 packets/sec in my tests, I got a median of 4466 packets/sec (0.75% error). <em>However</em>, for rates faster than 1000Hz, the calls to <code>sleep()</code> take zero time, so the RateLimiter burns CPU cycles until exceeding the wait time. Unfortunately we have no other choice since we can't use non-zero sleep times less than 1ms in Windows.

In Linux, the calls to <code>sleep()</code> took longer than requested, yielding a median of 3470 packets/sec (22.8% error). While <code>sleep()</code> in Linux takes longer than desired, requesting higher rates like 6000Hz yields a true rate higher than 4500, so we know that it's capable of the goal rate. The problem is in our <code>sleep()</code> value, which must be corrected to be lower than we might have expected. I performed another test, using the following (bad) approach.

<h2>Approach 2</h2>

In this approach, we never sleep. We chew up CPU cycles until the time elapses, which leads Python to use 100% of the core it's running on:

<pre><code>def execute(self, func, *args, **kwargs):
    if self.last_time_called is not None:
        # Sleep until we should wake up
        while True:
            now = timeit.default_timer()
            elapsed = now - self.last_time_called
            left_to_wait = self.min_interval - elapsed

            if left_to_wait &lt;= 0:
                break

            # (sleep removed from here)

    self.last_time_called = timeit.default_timer()
    return func(*args, **kwargs)
</code></pre>

<h3>Performance of Approach 2</h3>

In Linux, this yields a median rate of 4488 packets/sec (0.26% error), which is on par with Windows but eats the CPU the same way, so it's really inefficient.

<h1>The Question</h1>

Here's what I'm getting at. <strong>How do we use <code>sleep()</code> in Linux to keep our CPU usage reasonable while still having decent timing accuracy?</strong>

I figure this would have to involve some sort of monitoring and compensation process but I'm not really sure how to go about implementing such a thing. Is there a standard way to approach this kind of error-correction problem?

62,35469760,"I am currently working on finding polynomial equations to describe data sets (simple tables with one x and one y value) in Python. I need a polynomial equation to describe the data set so that given a number x I can derive it's y value. 

If I enter these data sets into Apple's Numbers app and plot them on a graph, I can get a very helpful polynomial equation that predicts my y values very accurately for my purposes. However, when using Num to derive a polynomial equation with the same data set, I am given a very different polynomial equation that makes incredibly inaccurate predictions. I want my Python program to create polynomial equations that are much closer to the ones produced by the numbers app.

Some specifics:

My x values (x_list): 3.75652173913043, 3.79130434782609, 3.82608695652174

My y values (y_list): 0.0872881944444445, 0.0872522935779816, 0.0858840909090909

My polynomial from Numbers: y = -0.5506x^2 + 4.1549x - 7.7508

My polynomial from Num: y = -7.586x^2 + 57.53x - 108.7

How I'm using Num: polynomial = num.poly1d(num.polyfit(x_list, y_list, deg=2))

My numbers in Python are rounded to 8 decimal points, but I think the discrepancy is too large for it to be a rounding issue.

In short, I am wondering how Numbers would have derived this polynomial vs. how Num would have, and how I can replicate the Numbers method, ideally without using Num. (I am going to have to translate my program from Python to Swift eventually.)

Is it possible to specify a float precision specifically for each column to be printed by the Python <code>pandas</code> package method <a href=""http://pandas.data.org/pandas-docs/dev/generated/pandas.DataFrame.to_csv.html"">pandas.DataFrame.to_csv</a>?

<h2>Background</h2>

If I have a <code>pandas</code> dataframe that is arranged like this:

<pre><code>In [53]: df_data[:5]
Out[53]: 
    year  month  day       lats       lons  vals
0   2012      6   16  81.862745 -29.834254   0.0
1   2012      6   16  81.862745 -29.502762   0.1
2   2012      6   16  81.862745 -29.171271   0.0
3   2012      6   16  81.862745 -28.839779   0.2
4   2012      6   16  81.862745 -28.508287   0.0
</code></pre>

There is the <code>float_format</code> option that can be used to specify a precision, but this applys that precision to all columns of the dataframe when printed.

When I use that like so:

<pre><code>df_data.to_csv(outfile, index=False,
                   header=False, float_format='%11.6f')
</code></pre>

I get the following, where <code>vals</code> is given an inaccurate precision:

<pre><code>2012,6,16,  81.862745, -29.834254,   0.000000

and I'm having trouble matching an arbitrary number of names between 1 and maybe 100.

Edit: I don't think I made it clear that the example strings I gave are small snippets of the actual text I'm searching. I'm checking the bodies of posts in /r/KarmaCourt, like these:

<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1ifz0u/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/1ifz0u/</a>
<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/28hv73/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/KarmaCourt/comments/28hv73/</a>

The question is revolving around structuring a regex. I don't want to know how to search the sample strings I gave for the names.

I know that <code>r'title.*/u/(\w{3:20})'</code> will match the last name in the line, <code>r'title.*?/u/(\w{3:20})'</code> will match the first in the line, and that I could manually add some number of <code>r'.*?/?u?/?(\w{3:20})?'</code> at the end of of the expression to match more names, but I can't help thinking that's a bad way of doing it.

Would it be better to take the matching string from <code>r'title.*?(?=/u/\w{3:20})(.*)'</code> and pull all the matching <code>r'/u/(\w{3:20})'</code> groups from that, or is there a way to do this all in one step that I'm fundamentally missing?

Note: this project is being done in , but this is more of a  fundamentals question.

92,17814340,"I am trying to get cython to realize I have a c compiler in MinGW 32-bit and I've tried everything I can find on the web but it's still not working. I am running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit. Here is what I have tried:

(1) I have Python 2.7 and I just installed MinGW with options gcc and g++ and some other options

(2) I edited the PATH environmental variable so it includes 

<pre><code>C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\local\bin;C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin
</code></pre>

(3) I told Python to use MinGW as the default compiler by creating a file named 

C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg, containing 

<pre><code>[build]
compiler = mingw32
</code></pre>

(I do have MinGW32 by the way)

(4) I removed all instances of -mno-cygwin from the file C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\cygwincompiler.

(5) I have a file called setup. and a module called tryingcython.x that is written in . My setup. says
    from distutils.core import setup
    from distutils.extension import Extension
    from Cython.Distutils import build_ext

<pre><code>setup(
    cmdclass = {'build_ext':build_ext},
    ext_modules=[Extension(""tryingcython"",[""tryingcython.x""])]
)
</code></pre>

So then I open Command Prompt and get into the directory that contains setup. and tryingcython.x, and I type
     setup. build_ext --inplace --compiler=mingw32

Then it tells me:

<pre><code>running build_ext
skipping 'tryingcython.c' Cython extension (up-to-date)
building 'tryingcython.c' extension
gcc -mdll -O -Wall -IC:\Python27\include -IC:\Python27\PC -c tryingcython.c -o build\
temp.win32-2.7\Release\tryingcython.o
error: command 'gcc' failed: No such file or directory
</code></pre>

So I guess Cython can't tell that I have gcc and it can't find it or what, even though I've tried about every single piece of advice I can find online for making it realize that I have MinGW which has gcc included. 
Any help/additional ideas on how I can get cython to actually work would be much appreciated.

This file daemonizes both celery and celerybeat. Celery is working fine. But celerybeat is not. I don't see celerybeat.log file created which I think suggests that celerybeat is not working.

Any ideas about this?

I will post more code if needed. Thanks for help

98,35962790,"In Python 3.5, is it possible to build a dictionary key/value pair using an <code>if</code> statement?

For example, given the following <code>if-conditional</code>:

<pre><code>if x == 1:
    color = 'blue'
elif x == 2:
    color = 'red'
else:
    color = 'purple'
</code></pre>

How can I create a dictionary key/value pair that incorporates this <code>if-conditional</code>?

<pre><code>dict(
    number = 3,
    foo = 'bar',
    color = 'blue' if x == 1, 'red' if x == 2, else 'purple'
)

100,38209020,"I need to find the positions of words in a sentence the user inputs and if the word occurs more than once, only print the first time that word occurs

I have the code so far-

<pre><code>sentence=input(""Enter a sentence: "")
sentence=sentence.lower()
words=sentence.split()
place=[]

for c,a in enumerate(words):
    if words.count(a)&gt;2 :

But it prints the positions of the individual words in the sentence rather than repeating a original position of a word that occurs more than once

Can anyone help me with this???

A possible output would be

Ultimately, I would like to be able to generate many of these assignment lists and to do so efficiently. My current method is just to create an zeroes array and set each consecutive subarray of length 3 to a random permutation of 3.

My first thought was to use num.diff which allows axis specification, however this returns a right difference rather than a central difference and has limited functionality. 

I understand the following method works using num.gradient

<pre><code>num_vectors=10 #number of 3-vectors in the 2D array
vectorarray=num.empty((num_vectors,3)) 
vectorarray[0]=[4,5,6]
vectorarray[1]=[1,4,4]
vectorarray[2]=[8,8,1] #add some arbitrary data for illustrative purposes

c1,c2=num.gradient(vectorarray)

So c1 stores the useful information that I require. The problem is that I also have to generate c2, and I want to do this sort of calculation with many dimensional arrays and will incur a time loss by generating all this useless data.

Is there any other method I can achieve this same result without the redundancy, preferably this also includes using nested for loops.

113,4871670,"I do a lot of statistical work and use Python as my main language. Some of the data sets I work with though can take 20GB of memory, which makes operating on them using in-memory functions in num, sci, and PyIMSL nearly impossible. The statistical analysis language SAS has a big advantage here in that it can operate on data from hard disk as opposed to  strictly in-memory processing. But, I want to avoid having to write a lot of code in SAS (for a variety of reasons) and am therefore trying to determine what options I have with Python (besides buying more hardware and memory).

I should clarify that approaches like map-reduce will not help in much of my work because I need to operate on <em>complete</em> sets of data (e.g. computing quantiles or fitting a logistic regression model). 

Recently I started playing with <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/h5/"">h5</a> and think it is the best option I have found for allowing Python to act like SAS and operate on data from disk (via hdf5 files), while still being able to  leverage num/sci/matplotlib, etc. I would like to hear if anyone has experience using Python and h5 in a similar setting and what they have found. Has anyone been able to use Python in ""big data"" settings heretofore dominated by SAS? 

EDIT: Buying more hardware/memory certainly can help, but from an IT perspective it is hard for me to sell Python to an organization that needs to analyze huge data sets when Python (or R, or MATLAB etc) need to hold data in memory. SAS continues to have a strong selling point here because while disk-based analytics may be slower, you can confidently deal with huge data sets. So, I am hoping that Stackoverflow-ers can help me figure out how to reduce the perceived risk around using Python as a mainstay big-data analytics language.

My primary tools are Django and either PostgreSQL or MySQL depending on the suggestions posted here.

I've been developing with Django for 5 years in the US, but have never needed internationalization or any Unicode support.  So my problem is, how do I handle Arabic words.

Here's my process:

1) I have a few .html files, with 's that have lines of Arabic words.  I will build a parser/tokenizer/stemmer and store to database

2) When the user enters a word for search, I'll stem it, and compare it against my database.

What I need help with, is the following:

1) Should the stems/words/lines be stored in the database as arabic words or as  unicode  strings

2) If I were to store them as Arabic words, what's better, PostgreSQL or MySQL and how do I support Arabic in either.

3) If I were to store them as unicode strings, will the django admin display them as Arabic words.  Because if so, that may suffice.  Also, can the admin support Arabic?  I.e. If I wanted to alter something in the database, can it be done via the admin.

4) How do I get the Django ORM to support storing Arabic words that the parser will spit out?

  When deserializing data, you always need to call is_valid() before
  attempting to access the deserialized object. If any validation errors
  occur, the .errors property will contain a dictionary representing the
  resulting error messages.

If I am trying to serialize and save many docs at a time, and one of the docs is invalid but all the rest are valid, does serializer.is_valid return true or false? The docs seem to suggest serializer.is_valid should be false, but there isn't a concrete example that addresses this subtlety.

This doesn't work .... I've searched everywhere and read the documentation.
But I just don't see how I can sort my (Base) query on their 'owner' relationship's name.

It always results in:


<pre><code> AttributeError: Neither 'InstrumentedAttribute' object nor 'Comparator' object has an attribute 'name'
</code></pre>

This must be easy... but I don't see it. Also looked into Comparators, which seemed logical, but I don't see where the query part for the ORDER BY is generated or what I should be returning since everything is generated dynamically. And making a comparator for each of my 'player' relationships to do a simple thing seems over complicated.

162,16553280,"I'm trying to write an app that needs large numbers of cryptographic strength pseudorandom bytes. 

The RC4 cipher would be ideal for this; it's lightweight and simple to understand conceptually. So, I got the spec and wrote an RC4 algorithm in Python.

It works exactly as expected, but, it's slow as molasses. On my Core i7 2.2GHz, I can only get about 1MB/sec out of the algorithm.

Clearly the interpreted nature of Python is not the best suited for this sort of task. My problem is I'm not well versed in C coding - the best I've done with C is some Hello World stuff and some experiments with file reading and writing. Either way, I certainly am not good enough with C to use the Python-C APIs.

I do know .NET/C#, and I wrote the same algorithm in Windows on C#, and I Was able to easily get over 60MB/sec out of it. So .NET's CLR is a lot more optimized. But, the target platform for the Python app is Unix/Linux.

Ideally, I don't want to have to go through tons of middle-layers just to get an optimized RC4 cipher into a Python app. 

Since RC4 depends on state, ideally I'd do this with a class (That's how I did it with my Python-only implementation.) So, here's a small snippet of what I want to be able to do:

<pre><code>rc4 = RC4Encrypter()
rc4.seed(myKey) # seed the RC4 algorithm with bytes from string myKey
rc4.getRC4Bytes(1048576) # get the next 1MB of RC4 cryptostream bytes as a binary string
rc4.encryptWithRC4(myString) # encrypt myString's bytes with RC4 bytes using xor and return

<pre><code>SomeFormSet= modelformset_factory(myModel, form=myModelForm, extra=0)    
SomeFormSet.form = staticmethod(curry(myModelForm, somevariable=somevariable))

formset = SomeFormSet(request.POST or None, queryset=somequeryset)
</code></pre>

And forms. is:

<pre><code>class myModelForm(forms.ModelForm):
    CHOICES = (
       (0, _('a')),
       (1, _('b')),
       (2, _('c')),
       (3, _('d')),
       )


    field = forms.IntegerField(widget=MultiStateSelectWidget(choices=CHOICES))


    class Meta:
        model = MyModal
        fields = ('field',)
        widgets = {'id': forms.HiddenInput(),
                 }

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.variable= kwargs.pop('variable')
        super(myModelForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        for field in myModelForm.fields:

            if self.instance.pk:

                if not getattr(self.instance, field):
                    self.initial[field]= 0
                else:
                    self.initial[field]= 1

                if anothercondition:
                    self.initial[field] = 3
                else:
                    self.initial[field] = 2
</code></pre>

I thought it worked very well. And the clicking and saving does work wel (I have a custom save method). Except when the form field has a value of 2 or 3, then it suddenly failes with the error message: 'field' should be a whole number.

If anyone could help that would be great, as I'm out of ideas!

EDIT: Just in case... I have checked the POST and it is great. The only problem is that Django somewhere in parsing the POST loses the value completely (it becomes None) if the value is a 2  and I have no idea why.

EDIT2: It seems that the Django ModelForm does also do model validation. And the model is a BooleanField, which is the reason why it fails. If anyone knows a good way to override it, that would be nice!

Database then creates a unique id for the table as <code>2</code> and <code>key</code> gets set as <code>TEST-2</code>.

186,6024990,"A PyQT beginner question.  I'm wondering how to do something like the following - modify widgets in the main window from outside the main window class.  Like so:

<pre><code>class MainWindow(QtGui.QMainWindow):    

    def __init__(self, parent=None):

        super(MainWindow,self).__init__(parent)

        self.ui = Ui_MainWindow()        
        self.ui.setupUi(self)

        self.ui.progressBar.setMaximum(100)
        self.ui.progressBar.setMinimum(0)
        self.ui.progressBar.setValue(0)

        self.connect(self.ui.pushButton, QtCore.SIGNAL('clicked()'), self.slotDoStuff)

    def slotDoStuff(self):
        AnotherFunction()


def AnotherFunction():    
    modify progress bar here...
</code></pre>

Is there a way to do something like this? I'd like to subclass the event handlers for various main window actions and not have them all in the MainWindow class.  Thanks!

187,30941170,"I'm trying to load the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) into a Pandas Data Frame in Python 3.4.  My code works, however it appears that I'm limited to 1,000 rows through the SODA API.  I'm using an app token and referencing the URL here

<pre><code>df = pd.read_json('http://data.consumerfinance.gov/resource/x94z-ydhh.json?$$app_token=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX')

The data structure is perfect, however I'm limited to only 1,000 rows of data (should be closer to 300,000 rows of data).

When I access the same URL through a browser (with app token), it appears it is pulling in only 1,000 rows as well.  I was under the impression that with an App Token you could access the entire data set, is that incorrect?

    monkeypatch.setattr('some_package.foo.bar', lambda: print('patched'))

To my surprise it outputs <code>hello</code> instead of <code>mock</code>. I tried to debug this thing putting ipdb breakpoint in the test. When I manually import <code>some_package.foo.bar</code> after breakpoint and call <code>bar()</code> I get <code>patched</code>.

On my real project the situation is even more interesting. If I invoke test in the project root my function isn't patched, but when I specify <code>tests/test_bar.</code> as an argument - it works.

As far as I understand it has something to do with the <code>from some_package.foo import bar</code> statement. If it's being executed before monkeypatching is happening then it patching fails. But on the condensed test setup from the example above patching does not work in both cases.

And why does it work in IPDB REPL after hitting a breakpoint?

193,25126520,"I have a dataframe with z-scores for several values. It looks like this:

<pre><code>ID    Cat1     Cat2     Cat3
A     1.05     -1.67    0.94
B     -0.88    0.22     -0.56
C     1.33     0.84     1.19
</code></pre>

I want to write a script that will tell me which IDs correspond with values in each category relative to a cut-off value I specify as needed. Because I am working with z-scores, I will need to compare the absolute value against my cut-off.

So if I set my cut-off at 0.75, the resulting dataframe would be:

<pre><code>Cat1    Cat2    Cat3
A       A       A
B       C       C
C
</code></pre>

If I set 1.0 as my cut-off value: the dataframe above would return:

<pre><code>Cat1    Cat2    Cat3
A       A       C
C
</code></pre>

I know that I can do queries like this:

<pre><code>df1 = df[df['Cat1'] &gt; 1]
df1
df1 = df[df['Cat1'] &lt; -1]
df1
</code></pre>

to individually query each column and find the information I'm looking for but this is tedious even if I figure out how to use the abs function to combine the two queries into one.How can I apply this filtration to the whole dataframe?

I've come up with this skeleton of a script:

<pre><code>cut_off = 1.0
cols = list(df.columns)
cols.remove('ID')
for col in cols:
    # FOR CELL IN VALUE OF EACH CELL IN COLUMN:
        if (abs.CELL &lt; cut_off):
            CELL = NaN
</code></pre>

to basically just eliminate any values that don't meet the cut-off. If I can get this to work, it will bring me closer to my goal but I am stuck and don't even know if I am on the right track. Again, the overall goal is to quickly figure out which cells have absolute-values above the cut-off in each category be able to list the corresponding IDs. 

I apologize if anything is confusing or vague; let me know in comments and I'll fix it. I've been trying to figure this out for most of today and my brain is somewhat fried

207,24876940,"I want to extend some classes from game, such as <code>Surface</code> and <code>Rect</code>. I could make use of inheritance, but this would not affect the calls made from game itself, that is, all the methods that return <code>Rect</code>s and <code>Surface</code>s.

For example, the statement <code>screen = game.display.set_mode()</code> returns a <code>game.Surface</code> and allows me to draw things on the screen via <code>screen</code>. If I create a class <code>MySurface(game.Surface)</code> and do something like <code>screen = MySurface()</code>, I obviously get the new functionality, but the ability to manipulate the screen is lost.

Is there some way of extending the functionality of such classes and applying it to external calls without having to modify any external files?

210,10047110,"I'm experimenting with file I/O. I have a small practice program that creates a text file when run. I packaged it with installer so that double clicking on the exe creates a new folder and places a text file with ""hello world"" inside of it. Easy peasy. 

Then I started wondering about <code>main()</code>. This is just a function like any other, right? So does that mean I can pass arguments to it at runtime? 

I was thinking about the Steam client and how you can put stuff like '-dev' and '-console' in the shortcut. Is there a way to do this to a  exe that I have made? 

I may be explaining terribly, so here's an example: 

<pre><code>def makeFile(string):
    if string:
        f = open('mytext.txt', 'w') #create text file in local dir
        print &gt;&gt; f, 'hello, ' + string + '! \nHow are ya?'

        f.close()

def main(string = None):
    makeFile(string)     
</code></pre>

So if I take this code and make it an exe, would I be able to add my optional arguments somehow.  

I tried the above code, and the running <code>test.exe --""myname""</code> but that didn't work. 

Is there a way to do this?

215,9087510,"I'm using the (awesome) <a href=""http://packages..org/mrjob/"">mrjob</a> library from Yelp to run my  programs in Amazon's Elastic Map Reduce.  It depends on subprocess in the standard  library.  From my mac running 2.7.2, everything works as expected

However, when I switched to using the exact same code on Ubuntu LTS 11.04 also with 2.7.2, I encountered something strange:

mrjob loads the job, and then attempts to communicate with its child processes using subprocess and generates this error:

<pre>
      File ""/usr/local/lib/2.7/dist-packages/mrjob-0.3.1-2.7.egg/mrjob/emr."", line 1212, in _build_steps
        steps = self._get_steps()
      File ""/usr/local/lib/2.7/dist-packages/mrjob-0.3.1-2.7.egg/mrjob/runner."", line 1003, in _get_steps
        stdout, stderr = steps_proc.communicate()
      File ""/usr/lib/2.7/subprocess."", line 754, in communicate
        return self._communicate(input)
      File ""/usr/lib/2.7/subprocess."", line 1302, in _communicate
        stdout, stderr = self._communicate_with_poll(input)
      File ""/usr/lib/2.7/subprocess."", line 1332, in _communicate_with_poll
        poller = select.poll()
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'poll'
</pre>

This appears to be a problem with subprocess and not mrjob.

I dug into /usr/lib/2.7/subprocess. and found that during import it runs:

<pre>
    if mswindows:
        ... snip ...
    else:
        import select
        _has_poll = hasattr(select, 'poll')
</pre>

By editing that, I verified that it really does set _has_poll==True.  And this is correct; easily verified on the command line.

However, when execution progresses to using Popen._communicate_with_poll somehow the select module has changed!  This is generated by printing dir(select) right before it attempts to use select.poll().

<pre>
    ['EPOLLERR', 'EPOLLET', 'EPOLLHUP', 'EPOLLIN', 'EPOLLMSG', 
    'EPOLLONESHOT', 'EPOLLOUT', 'EPOLLPRI', 'EPOLLRDBAND', 
    'EPOLLRDNORM', 'EPOLLWRBAND', 'EPOLLWRNORM', 'PIPE_BUF', 
    'POLLERR', 'POLLHUP', 'POLLIN', 'POLLMSG', 'POLLNVAL', 
    'POLLOUT', 'POLLPRI', 'POLLRDBAND', 'POLLRDNORM',
    'POLLWRBAND', 'POLLWRNORM', '__doc__', '__name__', 
    '__package__', 'error', 'select']
</pre>

no attribute called 'poll'!?!?  How did it go away?

So, I hardcoded _has_poll=False and then mrjob happily continues with its work, runs my job in AWS EMR, with subprocess using communicate_with_select... and I'm stuck with a hand-modified standard library...

Any advice? :-)

Expected ouput is <code>sys.argv: ['/home/moberg/tmp/test.', '-p', '--act=hej hej', '--exit']</code>

<strong>Clarification:</strong> This only happens when I use ssh in the command. Removing ""ssh"", ""localhost"" from the cmd and the argument is kept intact; output is what I expect:

<pre><code>./test. -p --act=""hej hej""

232,30058800,"I've been following Andrew Ng CSC229 machine learning course, and am now covering logistic regression.  The goal is to maximize the log likelihood function and find the optimal values of theta to do so.  The link to the lecture notes is: [<a href=""http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.ps][1]"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes1.ps][1]</a> -pages 16-19.  Now the code below was shown on the course homepage (in matlab though--I converted it to ). 

I'm applying it to a data set with 100 training examples (a data set given on the Coursera homepage for a introductory machine learning course).  The data has two features which are two scores on two exams.  The output is a 1 if the student received admission and 0 is the student did not receive admission.  The have shown all of the code below.  The following code causes the likelihood function to converge to maximum of about -62.  The corresponding values of theta are [-0.05560301  0.01081111  0.00088362].  Using these values when I test out a training example like [1,  30.28671077,  43.89499752] which should give a value of 0 as output, I obtain 0.576 which makes no sense to me.  If I test the hypothesis function with input [1, 10, 10] I obtain 0.515 which once again makes no sense.  These values should correspond to a lower probability.  This has me quite confused.

The problem is, my internet connection always got blocked/jammed/messed up after several hours running of this script, the situation is, from my script side I got urlopen error timed out each time it's requesting a page, and from my FireFox browser side I cannot open any site. But the weird thing is, the moment I close my script my Internet connection got back on immediately which means now I can surf any site through my browser, so it must be the script causing all the problem. 

I've checked the program carefully and even use <code>del</code> to delete any connection once it's used, still get the same problem. I only use urllib2, urllib, mechanize to do network requests. 

Anybody knows why such thing happens? How do I debug this problem? Is there a tool or something to check my network status once such situation occurs? It's really bugging me for a while...

By the way I'm behind a VPN, does it have something to do with this problem? Although I don't think so because my network always get back on once the script closed, and the VPN connection never drops(as it appears) during the whole process.

Should I just go ahead and roll out my own solution (could be a PITA).

Thanks

However, I have found that Python isn't loading the <code>*.c</code> files without their original <code>*.</code> files in place. (According to <a href=""http://www..org/dev/peps/pep-3147/"" rel=""nofollow"">PEP 3147</a>, the <code>*.c</code> files are kept in a subdirectory called <code>__cache__</code> in the directory where the <code>*.</code> file would be. I am following this convention with my own code.)

Under an earlier iteration of my project that used Python 2.7, I byte-compiled the Python sources and placed the generated <code>*.c</code> files into the same directory as the <code>*.</code> files; that worked just fine. Clearly, there is a problem with how Python is finding the <code>__cache__</code> folder. What am I doing wrong? (And yes, I have set <code>sys.path</code> appropriately; otherwise it would not be finding the <code>*.</code> file when I insert it as a debugging measure.)

<strong>EDIT 1</strong>
As suggested by Gabe, using

insted of :

An example:

<strong>[update]</strong> To clarify. The goal is not to put the stuff into another long method of course. Instead you can split the initialisation into different parts like:

<pre><code>def init_network_stuff(self):
    """""" init network setup """"""
    self.my_new_socket = socket.socket(..)


def init_local_stuff(self):

266,23340520,"As I noticed, on the one hand, there are bitwise operators in Python, like: <code>8 ^ 10</code> which results 2, that's fine.
 On the other hand, there are ways to convert a base 10 integer to a binary number, e.g. <code>bin(2)</code>

I wonder if I could combine this two, I mean there are no bitwise operators on strings, therefore, <code>bin(8) ^ bin(10)</code> only throws an error. I guess when using bitwise operators on integers, Python's first step is always a conversion anyways.

Actually I was thinking how I could speed up operations like <code>a ^ b</code> when both a and b are high values of integers and there are many bitwise operations on them. Conversion takes too much time so I'd like to just convert them in the first place and manipulating with bitwise operators only after.
 Maybe converting each number to bool lists could help, but I'm interested if anyone has a better idea.

270,4280460,"I have a lot of (e.g.) posts, that marked with one or more tags. Post can be created or deleted, and also user can make search request for one or more tags (combined with logical AND).
First idea that came to my mind was a simple model

<pre><code>class Post(db.Model):
  #blahblah
  tags = db.StringListProperty()
</code></pre>

Implementation of create and delete operations is obvious. Search is more complex. To search for N tags it will do N GQL queries like ""SELECT * FROM Post WHERE tags = :1"" and merge the results using the cursors, and it has terrible performance.

Second idea is to separate tags in different entities

<pre><code>class Post(db.Model):
    #blahblah
    tags = db.ListProperty(db.Key) # For fast access

class Tag(db.Model):
    name = db.StringProperty(name=""key"")
    posts = db.ListProperty(db.Key) # List of posts that marked with tag
</code></pre>

It takes Tags from db by key (much faster than take it by GQL) and merge it in memory, I think this implementation has a better performance than the first one, but very frequently usable tags can exceed maximal size that allowed for single datastore object. And there is another problem: datastore can modify one single object only ~1/sec, so for frequently usable tags we also have a bottleneck with modify latency.

Any suggestions?

275,33907750,"I frequently use num, and was recently caught off guard by the way conversion between data types was handled.

Suppose I have an unsigned, 8 bit integer (uint8) with a value of 252.  Let's create a new variable which increments this by 10, and print the value of the variable and its type.  It was not obvious to me what would happen here, since 252+10 > 255 (the max for uint8).  However we see that the addition has occurred ""normally"", resulting in 262.  The new variable is a 64 bit integer:

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import num as np 
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = np.uint8(252)
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a + 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (b, type(b))
262 &lt;class 'num.int64'&gt;
</code></pre>

Okay. Let's try a slightly different experiment.  This time I'll place the 252 into an array, and perform the same addition.  We see below that the result is now 6 instead of 262, meaning the addition has ""wrapped around"" zero.  The resulting array is still of type uint8.

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; c = np.array([1,2,252], dtype='uint8')
&gt;&gt;&gt; d = c + 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (d[2], np.dtype(d[2]))
6 uint8

My question is this: is there a good reason why num's behavior differs between these cases?  Perhaps the better question is: regardless of whether the reason is good or not, what is the rule that determines when such a conversion will occur?  Is it really just array vs. scalar behavior?

<li>Replaced SQLite as the database to Cassandra, like so:

2. And there is a nested error:

Of course, using a database would be probably the best option but given my dataset is very small, I would rather keep the program simple and just working with it on memory. Thus my question narrows down to:

<li>Is there a better way to represent a table on memory on ?</li>
<li>How would I go about obtaining a line out of it? (Given the best representation)</li>

What I can't figure out is where to fire my events.
It makes most sense to fire <code>e_hurt</code> event after the warrior was hurt, and <code>e_attack</code> event after the warrior has attacked.
However, this results into <code>victim.e_hurt</code> getting fired before <code>attacker.e_attack</code>, when <code>attacker</code> attacks <code>victim</code>:

    attacker.e_attack.subscribe(on_attack)
    attacker.attack(victim)

The two events get outputted in the ""wrong"" (programmatically correct, but semantically wrong) order:

<pre><code> Someone was hurt.
 Someone attacked.

Obviously the warrior has to attack before the other warrior can get hurt.
Of course I could just change the <code>attack</code>-method to look like this:

<pre><code>def attack(self, target):
    self.e_attack.fire()
    target.hurt(self.damage)

But it doesn't feel right to raise an attack event before the actual attack happens, and some other events might need to be called after the attack.

The only actual solution I can think of is to have two events (<code>before_attack</code> and <code>after_attack</code>) but is there a better solution that wouldn't need two events for one actual event (attacking)?

 It all works except the problem I am stuck with is that  I can not figure out how to get <code>os.rename</code> (I think that is what  I need to use) to work from inside my loop.

I have read up on it but I guess I just don't get how to tie it in.

<pre><code>import os

    if files.find('_The_Hype_Machine_') and files.endswith('.128.mp3') :
        mod_list = list(files) #Turns filenames into a list so they can be edited
        del(mod_list[-38:-4])  #specifies the piece of string I need taken out of each filename.
        files =''.join(mod_list) #Turns the list back to a string
        file_count += 1 
        updated_file = files.replace('_', ' ')

This works, but doesn't trim out anything, i.e. each section is captured, but all the rest (fields, elements) are captured. This probably comp sci 101, but I'm mostly teaching myself so this some sort of sorting algorithm I need to learn about. Any input on improving this appreciated.

I'm looking for a way to keep my <code>.ssh/config</code> file up-to-date, as I regularly spin up and shutdown EC2 instances, and it's very helpful to me if I can ssh into them easily for debugging and so on.

Entries within my SSH config file look like this

    local(w_com)
</code></pre>

As you can see, this will just keep prepending to my config file every time it's called, which is fine, because SSH takes the first section for each Host in config, but it means the file builds up and up. . .

I'm wondering if there are any Python libraries that allow one to treat <code>.ssh/config</code> as a more of a configuration file, whose relevant parts can be updated as and when. For example, it would be brilliant if you could simply treat <code>.ssh/config</code> as a dictionary and abstract away the file reading/writing. . .

349,11651960,"I have several modules that are within a Python package:

<pre><code># my_package contents
__init__.
module1.
module2.

Within my <code>__init__.</code>, I'm importing these modules so that they will be accessible once the package is imported by my users.

<pre><code># __init__.
import module1
import module2
</code></pre>

My question is:  how do I programatically access the docstrings for each of my defined functions within each of these modules?  I've seen <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/a/1270639/655787"">others</a> use a form of this:

<pre><code>getattr(module, key). __doc__
</code></pre>

but I can't get it to work for me.  Any ideas?

EDIT: A little more background... we're trying to extract content (one of the important things is the docstrings) from our  packages with the intent of using that as content for documentation.  My boss has something already set up that we're trying to feed into.

Ideally, I'd like to have a <code>package.module.function docstring</code> result

EDIT2:  Here's what is currently <strong>not</strong> working:

<pre><code>#my package is named 'tpp'
import tpp

for script in dir(tpp):
    if not ""__"" in script: #not a builtin...
        docstrings1 = getattr( tpp, script).__doc__
        docstrings2 = "" "".join(docstrings1.split())#clean out any newline chars
        print script, docstrings
</code></pre>

EDIT3:  To get a picture of where the docstrings are and how we've organized things:

<pre><code>import inspect
import tpp

inspect.getdoc(tpp)
#returns None

inspect.getdoc(tpp.module1)
#returns None

inspect.getdoc(tpp.module1.function1)
#'DOCSTRING TEXT FOUND!'

355,21065020,"As some of my projects are getting complicated and involve more work needed to actually deploy the application to the server, I wanted to ask for your help since I haven't had a lot of experience with this.

At the moment I have one app written in Flask, using MySQL as a backend, Apache with mod_wsgi, which is available at single EC2 instance. Now, things are about to get slightly more complicated, as I will have another ""cloned"" version of the application, on a different domain, with new templates, language and some minor differences, but the core code would be the same. I also have some sort of ""demo"" site, which is available at domain.com/demo, handled by different app since its functionality is kinda limited so its different from the  main version.

My deployment practice now, since this is relatively simple, to just <code>wget</code> the files from my Dropbox to the EC2 instance (I ssh in) and restart the apache service. As I have app code in a single file, and templates directory, and some other smaller scripts which are not updated often, this wasn't an issue. When I change code, I just get the source updated, and when I changed the templates, zip em, wget, unzip and that's it.

This was how I managed to do things so far. I recently started using GitHub as well for versioning, and would like some advice for my following concern:

<ul>
<li>Which would be the best way to automate this process? I suppose that prefered way is to pull things from the git repository upon each commit and deploy it on the EC2 instance. If this is the case, how can I automate this? Github hooks seem like a bit of an overkill, I hope there is ""simpler"" tool for this. Maybe beanstalk offered by Amazon can jump in?</li>

356,25002980,"I am trying to control my Raspberry Pi car via wireless and webiopi.  The basic function works fine - have the interface where I click fwd and the car will go forward and when I release the button it will stop.

I now want to integrate the Ultrasonic distance sensor so that when I drive forward, the car should stop when something is in front of it.  I have it going where when I click to fwd button, the car will drive and stop when something is in range but it will only stop when something is in range and not when I release the button. My while loop is somehow looping (stuck) and not reading the release button function from webiopi.

Can somebody please help - been at it for days now and not sure where I am going wrong :-( 

Here is the loop from my  script:

<pre><code>def go_forward(arg):
  global motor_stop, motor_forward, motor_backward, get_range
  print ""Testing""
  print mousefwd()
  while (arg) == ""fwd"":
      print (arg)
      direction = (arg)
      dist = get_range()
      print ""Distance %.1f "" % get_range()
      if direction == ""fwd"" and get_range() &lt; 30:
          motor_stop()
          return
      else:
          motor_forward()
</code></pre>

And here is the code from my webiopi function call:

<pre><code> function go_forward() {
              var args = ""fwd""
              webiopi().callMacro(""go_forward"", args);
      }
 function stop1() {
              var args = ""stop""
              webiopi().callMacro(""go_forward"", args);
              webiopi().callMacro(""stop"");
    }
</code></pre>

This is how I have it now but still not working (I am a total noob :-) ) :

<pre><code> def go_forward(arg):
  global motor_stop, motor_forward, motor_backward, get_range
  print ""Testing""
  direction = arg
  while direction == ""fwd"":
      print arg
      dist = get_range()
      print ""Distance %.1f "" % get_range()
      if get_range() &lt; 30:
         motor_stop()
      elif direction == ""fwd"":
         motor_forward()
      else:
         motor_stop()
</code></pre>

Maybe a slight step forward.  See that webipi uses its own 'loop' and I added the loop code to check what the status of the motor GPIO's are and the distance and if the motor is running and if the distance is too short then stop. Car moves now when I press the forward button and stops when I release it and when moving forward and distance is less then 30cm it will stop.  Only problem is that when the distance is too short and I press the forward button too quickly multiple times, I now get a ""GPIO.output(Echo,1)
_webiopi.GPIO.InvalidDirectionException: The GPIO channel is not an OUTPUT""  error :-(  .

The Code looks now like this:

<pre><code> def go_forward(direction):
   motor_forward()

 def loop():
   if get_range() &lt; 30 and GPIO.digitalRead(M1) == GPIO.HIGH:
     stop()
     print ""stop""

Can Django be used to provide an interface for this, for example taking live values and display them using

366,20202360,"I'm making a simple mp3 player that plays multiple mp3's at a time.  It acts like it is mixing.  Timing is critical to ensure a pleasant user experience, otherwise it just sounds like two cats trying to solve the mid east crisis.  I need accuracy down to 10ms, and probably will need 1ms accuracy if it doesn't work out.

Currently, I'm using wx and I find the timing functions very poor (but great for audio playback).

<pre><code>import wx
import wx.media

class MediaPanel(wx.Panel):
    INTERVAL = 10

    def tick(self, event):
        self.totalMS += self.INTERVAL

        if mixstart == self.totalMS:
            # play the song

        elif mixend == self.totalMS:
            # stop the song

        else 
            pass
</code></pre>

<hr>

So here's my issue:  I find that the timing is inconsistent.  I can have the same songs loaded up in a playlist ready to mix, and it will mix in at what seems like random times.  I'm still new to programming in general, and from what I can tell, it's the timing function that is not accurate.  For debugging purposes, I will print out a timestamp to let me know where I am in the functions.  For some reason, the timer will just stop randomly, then start up again.  

Question:  Is there a better way to do this?  Or is wx just broken for something like this?

375,3632210,"I want to create a server and client that sends and receives UDP packets from the network using Twisted. I've already written this with sockets in Python, but want to take advantage of Twisted's callback and threading features. However, I need help though with the design of Twisted. 

I have multiple types of packets I want to receive, but let's pretend there is just one:

<pre><code>class Packet(object):
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.packet_type = 1
        self.payload = ''
        self.structure = '!H6s'
        if data == None:
            return

        self.packet_type, self.payload = struct.unpack(self.structure, data)

    def pack(self):
        return struct.pack(self.structure, self.packet_type, self.payload)

    def __str__(self):
        return ""Type: {0}\nPayload {1}\n\n"".format(self.packet_type, self.payload)
</code></pre>

I made a protocol class (almost direct co of the examples), which seems to work when I send data from another program:

<pre><code>class MyProtocol(DatagramProtocol):
    def datagramReceived(self, data, (host, port)):
        p = Packet(data)
        print p

reactor.listenUDP(3000, MyProtocol())
reactor.run()
</code></pre>

What I don't know is how do I create a client which can send arbitrary packets on the network, which get picked up by the reactor:

<pre><code># Something like this:
s = Sender()
p = Packet()
p.packet_type = 3
s.send(p.pack())
p.packet_type = 99
s.send(p.pack())
</code></pre>

I also need to make sure to set the reuse address flag on the client and servers so I can run multiple instances of each at the same time on the same device (e.g. one script is sending heartbeats, another responds to heartbeats, etc). 

Can someone show me how this could be done with Twisted? 

<strong>Update</strong>:

This is how I do it with sockets in Python. I can run multiple listeners and senders at the same time and they all hear each other. How do I get this result with Twisted? (The listening portion need not be a separate process.)

<pre><code>class Listener(Process):
    def __init__(self, ip='127.0.0.1', port=3000):
        Process.__init__(self)
        self.ip = ip
        self.port = port

    def run(self):
        sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
        sock.bind((self.ip, self.port))

        data, from_ip = sock.recvfrom(4096)
        p = Packet(data)
        print p

class Sender(object):
    def __init__(self, ip='127.255.255.255', port=3000):
        self.sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
        self.sock.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)
        self.ip = (ip, port)

    def send(self, data):
        self.sock.sendto(data, self.ip)

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    l = Listener()
    l.start()
    s = Sender()
    p = Packet()
    p.packet_type = 4
    p.payload = 'jake'
    s.send(p.pack())
</code></pre>

<strong>Working solution</strong>:

<pre><code>class MySender(DatagramProtocol):
    def __init__(self, packet, host='127.255.255.255', port=3000):
        self.packet = packet.pack()
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    def startProtocol(self):
        self.transport.write(self.packet, (self.host, self.port))

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    packet = Packet()
    packet.packet_type = 1
    packet.payload = 'jake'

    s = MySender(packet)

    reactor.listenMulticast(3000, MyProtocol(), listenMultiple=True)
    reactor.listenMulticast(3000, s, listenMultiple=True)

376,26343260,"I have a working Django PyCharm 3.4.1 project which i have been working on for month without problems!

But now PyCharm <em>for some reason marks all  build-in exceptions as unresolved</em>. Other Features like code completion and debugging remain to work fine.

<h3>How it happend</h3>

The issue started as i created a package named ""exceptions"" and tried to move a few Exception-derived classed via ""refactor"" into that package - the operation completed without displaying any error but the involved source files were not modified as if the operation did not happen.

After realizing the possible name conflict with the build-in exceptions i deleted the folder - effectively putting the source files back into the initial state. 

<h3>Additional Description</h3>

<ul>
<li>At that point exceptions like IOError, Exception, KeyError where not resolved correct any more.</li>
<li>As a quickfix the IDE suggests to create the respective class, rename the reference or ignore the problem.</li>
<li>the editor shows unresolved reference but in the project explorer the concerned files are not underlined red.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attempts to fix the issue</h3>

Unfortunate the issue remained even after i:

<ul>
<li>closed and reopened the project</li>
<li>invalidated all Caches and restarted the IDE multiple times</li>
<li>switched the  interpreter</li>
</ul>

Do you have ideas or suggestions on how to make PyCharm get these names right again and to resolve the issue?

384,19072110,"I have a collection of <code>N</code> points in three dimensions.  These are stored as an <code>np.array</code> with a shape of <code>(N,3)</code>.  All of the points are distinct with the minimum distance between any two points being <code>~1e-5</code>.  I am looking for a means of obtaining an order in which to iterate over these points which is both independent of their current order in the <code>np.array</code> and robust to small perturbations of individual components.

The simplest means of satisfying the first requirement is with <code>np.lexsort</code> with

<pre><code>np.lexsort(my_array.T)
</code></pre>

however this fails in the robustness department:

<pre><code>In [6]: my_array = np.array([[-0.5, 0, 2**0.5], [0.5, 0, 2**0.5 - 1e-15]])

In [7]: my_array[np.lexsort(my_array.T)]
Out[7]: 
array([[ 0.5       ,  0.        ,  1.41421356],
       [-0.5       ,  0.        ,  1.41421356]])
</code></pre>

where we can see that in this instance the ordering is extremely sensitive to perturbations.  I am therefore looking for a fuzzy variant of <code>np.lexsort</code> which will move onto the next axis if two values in one axis are within a tolerance of <code>epsilon</code>.  (Or any alternative mechanism which will permit me to obtain an ordering.)

As my application has several million of these collections, all of which need ordering, performance is something of a concern (which is why I have not blindly tried to roll my own tolerant np.lexsort without first seeing if there is a better way to do it).

My new app will not load any files in the <code>/site_media/</code> directory, via the <code>{{ MEDIA_URL }}</code>. They are attempting to path from the App's directory, not the <code>/site_media/</code> directory.

<hr>
<strong>Example:</strong> 
Instead of loading from <code>http://sitename/site_media/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css</code> 

it tries to load from <code>http://sitename/foo/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.css</code>

<hr>

Here is a snippet from the <code>settings.</code> which defines the <code>MEDIA_URL</code> 

<pre><code>MEDIA_URL = '/site_media/'
</code></pre>

I can force the files to load correctly in the app by replacing <code>{{ MEDIA_URL }}</code> with <code>/site_media/</code> in the <code>base.html</code> and my <code>show_foo.html</code>, but this then breaks the pathing on the rest of the site.

I'm not sure what else anyone would like to see to try and diagnose the issue, but I'm stumped!

413,8319910,"<strong>Disclaimer</strong>: This is for a semester project that I am currently working on. My question is regarding an implementation level detail and is not part of the grading scheme. I am only writing this code as a way to test the theory that I am proposing for the paper that I will write.

Also, I have considered the answers for <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2989870/assigning-ids-to-instances-of-a-class-ic"">this question</a> with little luck, so please do not consider this as a duplicate of that question

<strong>The Problem</strong>:

I have a graph (G=(V,E)). At some point in my algorithm, I need to turn this into a hypergraph (in a sense) by ""collapsing"" multiple nodes (say, <code>v_1, v_2, ..., v_n</code>) into one node (say, <code>v</code>). In the context of the problem, this implies that I need to change the edges in <code>E</code> such that any edge <code>e</code> between any of <code>v_1, v_2, v_n</code> and any other node <code>u</code> in <code>V</code> will be changed such that <code>e</code> is now between <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>.

In order to capture that there may now exist multiple distinct edges between any pair of nodes, I need to make a unique identifier for each edge. I have tried to do this by means of and ID, which I am currently unable to properly implement.

<strong>This is what I've tried</strong>:

<pre><code>class Edge:
    _ID = 0
    def __init__(self, u, v, w, c,f=0):
        self.id = Edge._ID 
        Edge._ID += 1
        self.src = u
        self.dest = v
        self.weight = w
        self.capacity = c
        self.flow = f
</code></pre>

However, when I try to instantiate a new edge, I get the following error:

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = Edge(1,3,5,10,0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
  File ""UnsplittableFlow."", line 14, in __init__
    self.id = Edge._ID; Edge._ID += 1
UnboundLocalError: local variable '_ID' referenced before assignment
</code></pre>

<strong>EDIT</strong>:

With the suggestions of some answers, I have been able to fix the instantiation-time error. However, another error persists. Here is my code and the errors:

<pre><code>class Edge:
    _ID = 0
    def __init__(self, u, v, w, c,f=0):
        self.id = self._ID; self._ID += 1
        self.src = u
        self.dest = v
        self.weight = w
        self.capacity = c
        self.flow = f
</code></pre>

Error:

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; e = Edge(1,3,5,10,0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; e.id
0
&gt;&gt;&gt; Edge._ID
0

&gt;&gt;&gt; f = Edge(2,3,5,10,0)
&gt;&gt;&gt; f.id

The function rotate takes an index of a square in the chain and rotates the whole chain after that square by 90 degrees, pivoting around the initial square. The problem is that this is meant to mimic a physical toy so it is not allowed to collide with itself.  I can check to see if two squares are on top of each other after a rotation but how can I make sure they wouldn't collide temporarily during a rotation?

427,35635850,"I am trying to work around the 999 variable limit inherent in SQLite when wrapped by ORMs such as <code>peewee</code>. I am trying to construct a few dozen tables with ~50k rows and ~20 columns each. However, due to the 999 limit, I have to limit my inserts to ~50 rows per insert statement. This is extremely slow.

How can I make this faster? If I do not have a primary key constraint, then this requirement goes away, as I can just use <code>pandas</code> to dump directly to SQL, but then modifying later to have a primary key is a pain.

Here is an example:

<pre><code>from peewee import *

database = SqliteDatabase(None)

class Base(Model):
    class Meta:
        database = database


colnames = [""A"", ""B"", ""C"", ""D"", ""E"", ""F"", ""G"", ""H""]
cols = {x: TextField() for x in colnames}

table = type('mytable', (Base,), cols)
database.init('test.db')
database.create_tables([table])

data = []
for x in range(150):  # if this number is any higher this crashes
    data.append({x: 1 for x in colnames})


with database.atomic() as txn:
    table.insert_many(data).execute()
</code></pre>

How can I get around this limitation? In the <code>peewee</code> documentation, they mention using <code>apsw</code>, which has the ability to modify the SQLite max_variables variable, but I am worried about the effects of increasing this variable to some huge number.

<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CDuGd.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/CDuGd.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

I have a text file with x y point groups that I should plot. However, the x points overlap in each group, so I add an offset to each x axis point for each group.

Usually, the single groups look like this:

<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6vzDa.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/6vzDa.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>
<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lJ9lb.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lJ9lb.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

Note that the x axis in the first image ends where the x-axis in the second image begins.

My problem is that the resulting image is squelched/compressed and not really ""readable"".

I tried increasing the value that is added to the x-axis for each group/image, but it just compresses each group even more.

I tried suggestions to use <code>rcParams</code> or set the <code>dpi</code> value of the resulting image, but nothing does the job:

<pre><code>from lab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 50, 100
plt.savefig('result.png', dpi=200,pad_inches=5)

What am I doing wrong or looking for?

I realize that you can overload operators to work with custom classes, but is there a way to overload operators to work with pairs?

Of course, such solutions as

<pre><code>c = tuple([x+y for x, y in zip(a, b)])

do work, but, let aside performance, they aren't quite as pretty as overloading the <code>+</code> operator. 

One can of course define <code>add</code> and <code>mul</code> functions such as 

<pre><code>def add((x1, y1), (x2, y2)):
    return (x1 + x2, y1 + y2)

def mul(a, (x, y)):
    return (a * x, a * y)

but still being able to write <code>q * b + r</code> instead of <code>add(times(q, b), r)</code> would be nicer.

<strong>EDIT</strong>: On a side note, I realize that since <code>+</code> currently maps to tuple concatenation, it might be unwise to redefine it, even if it's possible. The question still holds for <code>-</code> for example =)

449,36851140,"I'm trying to add a Tk.Scale widget to my application, but I have a problem with setting non-integer value to the resolution parameter. If I pass an <em>integer</em> value to Scale constructor, it works correctly, but with any <em>non-integer</em> value (say 0.1) my scale widget does not move. It appears at the right place and looks just fine, but doesn't respond to my attempts to move it.

Here is my code related to the creation of scale widget:

<pre><code>    self.sliderValue = Tk.DoubleVar()
    self.slider = Tk.Scale(self.frame,
                           from_=float(self.lowerValue.get()),

                           length=180,

                           command=self.sliderMoved)
</code></pre>

The problem is I can not reproduce this issue outside of my application. In other words, if I create just a simple window with one scale widget, it works with any resolution values. So it seems that the problem is hidden somewhere outside of this constructor call, but I can not figure out where. May be someone had the same problem and can advise me what should I check.

Addition:
May be it is important: in standalone (working) case the value above the slider is in ""1.0"" format (with the dot as the separator), and in my broken application it is ""1,0"" format (with the comma as the separator). May by some kind of type/format mismatch is happening here.

Addition 2:

Here is minimal example:

<pre><code>import Tkinter as Tk
from lab import *

# cla()  # if you uncomment these two lines,
# clf()  # scale will break for non-int resolutions

466,6838380,"I have an application that uses Flash for the GUI and Python for the core logic. This combination is awesome. Unfortunately my current approach only works on Windows, as it uses the wxPython comtypes library to embed the Flash ActiveX player. Every other aspect of the app is platform-agnostic, so I'm thinking there must be some way on Linux to have Python talk to Flash.

The SWF need not require AVM2/AS3, though ideally I could use the most current Flash player available. I am using wxPython (wxWidgets) and would prefer to keep using it. Worst case I could jerry-rig something that loads the SWF in a separate process and talks over a socket connection to the Python, but I see no simple way to have the Flash display inside my application's window rather than a player window with its own menus and decorations.

Any suggestions appreciated. I'm very open to hacking at a solution if there's reason to believe it will work :)

This is how a ""stokes_line"" is generated:

<pre><code>os.system('pdv -t %s &gt; temp.txt ' % epoch_name)
    stokes_line = np.genfromtxt('temp.txt', usecols=3, dtype=[('stokesI','float')],     skip_header=1)

os.system('vap -nc ""mjd"" %s &gt;&gt; mjd.txt' % new_y[i])
stokes_list[b] = stokes_line
</code></pre>

""pdv"" is a command from another programme which generated some numbers used in the ""stokes_line"".

stokes_list just gets a new stokes_line added too each in a loop each time.

<strong>EDIT:</strong>

A stokes_line is created with a num.genfromtxt command (and so extracts from a txt file) and is made up of floats and they look like this:

<blockquote>
  [(0.00126596,) (0.000621272,) (0.00058694,) ..., (0.0015368,)
  (0.000926448,) (7.95851e-05,)]
</blockquote>

A bunch of them together make up a stokes_list, and each stokes_line is made up of the same number of floats.

Is the problem because the genfromtxt is not creating a list which would be all square brackets, but something else (is it called a sequence)??

<hr>

I wrote a  code which worked find on my laptop ( version 2.7.3), but it doesn't seem to run on my university desktop ( version 2.5.2).

I don't think that showing lots of the code here will be useful, but the error message is on the second of these two lines:

<pre><code>os.system('vap -nc ""mjd"" %s &gt;&gt; mjd.txt' % new_y[i])
stokes_list[b] = stokes_line
</code></pre>

Where ""vap"" is a command from another programme which returns some values. Anyway, the crux of the matter is that I get the following error message ONLY when I run on the older version of Python:

<blockquote>
  ValueError: setting an array element with a sequence.
</blockquote>

Now I did a little research, and people say that the problem is due to incompatible lengths of lists of some such - but if that was the case, why does it work fine when I run it on my newer version of Python.

Any help would be great, thank you!

476,4242770,"Using: Django with Python

Overall objective: Call a function which processes video conversion (internally makes a curl command to the media server) and should immediately return back to the user.

Using message queue would be an overkill for the app. 
So I had decided to use threads, I have written a class which overwrites the init and run method and calls the curl command 

<pre><code>class process_video(Thread):
    def __init__ (self,video_id,video_title,fileURI):
        Thread.__init__(self)
        self.video_id = video_id 
        self.video_title = video_title
        self.fileURI = fileURI
        self.status =-1

    def run(self):
        logging.debug(""FileURi"" + self.fileURI)
        curlCmd = ""curl --data-urlencode \""fileURI=%s\"" %s/finalize""% (self.fileURI, settings.MEDIA_ROOT)
        logging.debug(""Command to be executed"" + str(curlCmd))
        #p = subprocess.call(str(curlCmd), shell=True)

        logging.debug(""value returned from media server:"")
        logging.debug(output_media_server)
</code></pre>

And I instantiate this class from another function called createVideo
 which calls like this <code>success = process_video(video_id, video_title, fileURI)</code>

Problem: 
The user gets redirected back to the other view from the createVideo and the processVideo gets called, however for some reason the created thread (process_video) doesn't wait for the output from the media server.

483,34073370,"Since Python 3.3, if a generator function returns a value, that becomes the value for the StopIteration exception that is raised. This can be collected a number of ways:

<ul>
<li>The value of a <code>yield from</code> expression, which implies the enclosing function is also a generator.</li>
<li>Wrapping a call to <code>next()</code> or <code>.send()</code> in a try/except block.</li>
</ul>

However, if I'm simply wanting to iterate over the generator in a for loop - the easiest way - there doesn't appear to be a way to collect the value of the StopIteration exception, and thus the return value. Im using a simple example where the generator yields values, and returns some kind of summary at the end (running totals, averages, timing statistics, etc).

<pre><code>for i in produce_values():
    do_something(i)

values_summary = ....??
</code></pre>

One way is to handle the loop myself:

<pre><code>values_iter = produce_values()
try:
    while True:
        i = next(values_iter)
        do_something(i)
except StopIteration as e:
    values_summary = e.value
</code></pre>

But this throws away the simplicity of the for loop. I can't use <code>yield from</code> since that requires the calling code to be, itself, a generator. Is there a simpler way than the roll-ones-own for loop shown above?    

<h2>Answer summary</h2>

Combining answers from @Chad S. and @KT, the simplest appears to turn my generator function into a class using the iterator protocol:

<pre><code>class ValueGenerator():
    def __iter__(self):
        yield 1
        yield 2
        # and so on
        self.summary = {...}

vg = ValueGenerator()
for i in vg:
    do_something(i)
values_summary = vg.summary

And @Ferdinand Beyer's answer is simplest if I can't refactor the value producer.

I would like to specify the scale of the x-axis for my scatter plot similar to excel.

491,24619360,"I've got a relatively simple SSL server running in Twisted and I'd like to write some unit tests for it.  I'm not really sure the best way to do this when using Python 3.  All the documentation I've found describes using Twisted Trial which unfortunately is incomplete for Py3k.

What I'm thinking is doing something like this:

<ul>
<li>loading up my code and doing everything but <code>reactor.run()</code></li>
<li>send the data I want my code to handle</li>
<li>run <code>reactor.doIteration()</code> (or maybe <code>reactor.iterate()</code> is better?)</li>
<li>check that my server did what it was supposed to</li>
</ul>

Is this a legitimate way of handling this sort of situation?

EDIT 2:

I guess the major issue is when you're trying to test components intertwined with Twisted and you're not sure how to pull it apart to properly test the individual components.  Is there any reliable way to test this?  Should <code>.run()</code> be called and then insert an event that's run a few seconds after you've completed your action to stop the reactor and test the result?

492,10474880,"I have a website that gets user input from checkboxes and returns the corresponding rows from a MySQL table. 

For example, the user can select a couple colors and the website will show the objects from the table that are that color.

The problem is when the user only selects one color the MySQL query is not created properly and I get an error. Note the <code>colors</code> array below:

So this works:

<pre><code>import MySQLdb

One can optionally write

Is there anyone who knows of a way to pass <strong>ANY</strong> desired set of argument to an operator in the same way arguments can be passed to a function?

If we pass <code>a=6.0</code> then we get 

<pre><code>*** ValueError: 'axis' entry is out of bounds
</code></pre>

The desired behavior would be that we get same return value <code>6.0</code> not (<code>[6.0]</code>)  for both inputs.

What is the correct ic and safe way to handle this? <code>type</code>? <code>shape</code>?

546,21507870,"I have a text file that lists 10,000,000 YouTube video IDs, like this:

<pre><code>9bZkp7q19f0
t4H_Zoh7G5A
9bZkp7q19f0
etc...
</code></pre>

I open the file, take the YouTube video ID, and look it up to see what its statistics are:
<a href=""https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=topicDetails,statistics&amp;id=9bZkp7q19f0&amp;key="" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/videos?part=topicDetails,statistics&amp;id=9bZkp7q19f0&amp;key=</a>{API_KEY}  For the first video (Psy Gangnam Style), the API call returned:

<pre><code>  ""viewCount"": ""1895378471"",
  ""likeCount"": ""8110831"",
  ""dislikeCount"": ""976065"",
  ""favoriteCount"": ""0"",
  ""commentCount"": ""5100187""
</code></pre>

I also calculate custom values such as how many times each video was contained in the file, incrementing by one each time.

I need to record all this information into some type of Python data structure, which would look like this:

<pre><code>videoID    ,  viewCount, count, etc
9bZkp7q19f0, 1895378471, 10000
t4H_Zoh7G5A,  512345678, 10000
</code></pre>

Since videoIDs often repeat in the input file, I would not just append new rows to the data structure, but need to be able to just find the existing row, and increment the value of count.

I think that text like ""videoID"", ""count"", etc do not really have to be in the data structure, a two dimensional type of array is fine, as long as I know what each column represents.

The point of this question is I am trying to decide what type of data structure would be best.  Performance is critical.  

I must be able to quickly determine by the videoID, the key, if that row already exists in the data structure, so if I could index the first column, that would be ideal.

What type of Python data structure could accomplish this?

Currently I'm creating this test data in the <code>setUp</code> function of each <code>TestCase</code>. But this means that I'm creating the same data over and over again, which seem very stupid and unnecessary.

It seems that when BeautifulSoup encounters a closing tag (in my case <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code>) that was never opened, it decides to end the document instead.
Also, the <code>find</code> method seems to not search the contents behind the (self-induced) <code>&lt;/html&gt;</code> tag in this case. This means that when the block I'm interested in happens to be behind a spurious closing tag, I can't access the contents.

586,2426690,"Here is my problem. I have created a pretty heavy readonly class making many database calls with a static ""factory"" method. The goal of this method is to avoid killing the database by looking in a pool of already-created objects if an identical instance of the same object (same type, same init parameters) already exists.

If something was found, the method will just return it. No problem. But if not, how may I create an instance of the object, in a way that works with inheritance?

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; class A(Object):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     @classmethod
&gt;&gt;&gt;     def get_cached_obj(self, some_identifier):
&gt;&gt;&gt;         # Should do something like `return A(idenfier)`, but in a way that works

&gt;&gt;&gt; class B(A):
&gt;&gt;&gt;     pass

&gt;&gt;&gt; A.get_cached_obj('foo') # Should do the same as A('foo')
&gt;&gt;&gt; A().get_cached_obj('foo') # Should do the same as A('foo')

587,14126770,"This question has been asked, in various flavors, several times. Unfortunately, none of the answers have yielded a solution for me. 

I am attempting to connect to a  web server (code to follow) using the https protocol, with client side authentication included. When I connect via a  client that I wrote for testing, I have no problems. Fast forward, I am now trying to connect from an Android device (code to follow again) and am getting a     

<pre><code>x.net.ssl.SSLProtocolException
</code></pre>

I have a self signed CA, which has issued two certificates. One for the client and one for the server.

I removed the passphrase from the server private key using:

<code>openssl rsa -in serverKey.pem -out serverKey.pem</code> 

and issued a request using openssl from the linux command line. 

For the client I issued a request, created the certificate and then used keytool with the BouncyCastle provider to import the CA into a trust store and the client certificate into a key store (I realize they are the same format, it just helps me to keep them separated if I refer to them by different names).

It should be noted that I am using the x.net.ssl library and not the apache one.

EDIT:
The  server is hosted on a Windows machine. Is there any extra configuration that needs to be taken into account for ssl on a Windows port?

EDIT: Yes, there is something that needs to be done to allow SSL on a windows port. Switched to port 443 (designated for SSL traffic) and am making (slow) progress. 

EDIT:
I am now able to track the request using Wireshark (I am learning a lot for this problem!) and Wireshark is telling me that there is a 405 error. Which in SSL means that the certificate format is not recognized. The  server is using PEM certificates (the only format allowed according to  docs) and the certificates imported into the keystore on the Android device are DER (to my knowledge the only format accepted by BKS).

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Lxml records validation errors in an array on the specification itself, therefore I will need a new co of the specification for each validation I perform.

I cannot do a thread-safe cd, so I read all the specs at application launch.  

It is not desirable to re-parse either (XSD or DTD) specification because it takes I/O time and parsing time.

My attempts at co and deepco of the spec (DTD and XMLSchema objects) failed outright.

I understand that this is probably horribly inefficient, but it seems to almost work. My issue  is this: I would like to, once the loop is finished appending to all_lines_max, print the largest value of that list. However, there doesn't seem to be a way to print the max of that list without doing it on every line, if that makes sense. Any ideas on my convoluted code?

600,33376840,"Dire performance situation: I have a web app where users leave messages and spectators upvote/downvote them. It's developed using Django. I have a <code>ListView</code> that populates the home page with users' latest messages. 

My simple <strong>models.</strong> contains:

<pre><code>class MessageVoteCountManager(models.Manager):
     def get_query_set(self):
          return super(MessageVoteCountManager, self).get_query_set().annotate(votes=Sum('vote__value'))

class Message(models.Model):
     description = models.TextField()
     submitted_by = models.ForeignKey(User) # django.contrib.auth.models user
     submitted_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add = True)

     with_votes = MessageVoteCountManager()

class Vote(models.Model):
     voter = models.ForeignKey(User)
     message = models.ForeignKey(Message)
     value = models.IntegerField(default = 0)
</code></pre>

In my <strong>views.</strong>, I have a <code>ListView</code> to support the functionality I described in the first paragraph. It's basic skeleton is like so:

<pre><code>class MessageListView(ListView):
     model = Message
     queryset = Message.objects.order_by('-submitted_on')[:120]
     paginate_by = 10
</code></pre>

Recently, I changed the queryset definition above to <code>queryset = Message.with_votes.order_by('submitted_on')[:120]</code> In other words, I annotated <code>votes</code> with each <code>message</code>, which is the <strong>sum</strong> of all <code>votes</code> a <code>message</code> instance has received. The moment this change went live, the following happened (new relic output). I <em>reverted</em> the commit at 6:27AM:

<a href=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/POupx.png"" rel=""nofollow""><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/POupx.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a>

My best guess is that that I have half a million <code>messages</code> in my DB. Maybe once I change the <code>queryset</code> definition, requests queue up to recalculate all <code>messages</code> ever entered, and my app essentially suffers severely deprecated performance? I only want to apply this new <code>queryset</code> calculation to the latest <strong>120</strong> <code>messages</code> - hence I sliced the latest 120 after ordering them by date. This clearly didn't work.

How do I make sure the new <code>queryset</code> definition only applies to the <strong>latest</strong> <code>messages</code>, coming onwards from the point of changing the code? Something like: <code>(Message.objects.order_by('submitted'on')[:120]).with_votes</code> ?

Please ask me for more information if it's needed. My ultimate goal is to get better performance here.

In order to ""undo"" or ""reverse"" the max-pooling step, one method is to store the locations of the maxima as auxiliary data, then simply recreate the un-pooled data by making a big array of zeros and using those auxiliary locations to place the maxima in their appropriate locations.

Here's how I'm currently doing it:

<pre><code>import num as np

    return upsampled


totalitems = minibatchsize * numfilters * numsamples

code = theano.shared(np.arange(totalitems).reshape((minibatchsize, numfilters, numsamples)))

auxpos = np.arange(totalitems).reshape((minibatchsize, numfilters, numsamples)) % upsampfactor  # arbitrary positions within a bin
auxpos += (np.arange(4) * 5).reshape((1,1,-1)) # shifted to the actual temporal bin location
auxpos = theano.shared(auxpos.astype(np.int))

print ""code:""
print code.get_value()
print ""locations:""
print auxpos.get_value()
get_upsampled = theano.function([], upsamplecode(code, auxpos))
print ""the un-pooled data:""
print get_upsampled()

This method <strong>works</strong> but it's a <strong>bottleneck</strong>, taking most of my computer's time (I think the set_subtensor calls might imply cpu&lt;->gpu data coing). So: can this be implemented more efficiently?

I suspect there's a way to express this as a single <code>set_subtensor()</code> call which may be faster, but I don't see how to get the tensor indexing to broadcast properly.

<hr>

<strong>UPDATE:</strong> I thought of a way of doing it in one call, by working on the flattened tensors:

<pre><code>def upsamplecode2(encoded, auxpos):
    shp = encoded.shape
    upsampled = T.zeros((shp[0], shp[1], shp[2] * upsampfactor))

    add_to_flattened_indices = theano.shared(np.array([ [[(y + z * numfilters) * numsamples * upsampfactor for x in range(numsamples)] for y in range(numfilters)] for z in range(minibatchsize)], dtype=theano.config.floatX).flatten(), name=""add_to_flattened_indices"")

    upsampled = T.set_subtensor(upsampled.flatten()[T.cast(auxpos.flatten() + add_to_flattened_indices, 'int32')], encoded.flatten()).reshape(upsampled.shape)

    return upsampled


get_upsampled2 = theano.function([], upsamplecode2(code, auxpos))
print ""the un-pooled data v2:""
ups2 = get_upsampled2()
print ups2
</code></pre>

However, this is still not good efficiency-wise because when I run this (added on to the end of the above script) I find out that the Cuda libraries can't currently do the integer index manipulation efficiently:

609,22835630,"I have a huge MongoDB collection (~0.5 Million documents).

The structure is like this:

<pre><code>{'_id': '.....',
'passid':'ag325gdtew',
'text': '.......',
'count': '.......',
'title': '......',
'body': '.......'
}
</code></pre>

The field <code>passid</code> is the same in many documents and I want to combine them with a different way for each field.

I want to:

<ul>
<li>keep the same <code>passid</code></li>
<li>join text and title in each document (text+title) and then join the final string in one field on the new document (text1+text2+text3)</li>
<li>create a field list with each count [count1, count2, count3]</li>
<li>remove the body field</li>
</ul>

So the new document will be like this:

<pre><code>{'_id': '.....',
'passid':'ag325gdtew',
'text': '.......', (string)
'count': ['..','...','..'] (list)
}
</code></pre>

At the moment, I am doing it with Python but the file is huge and the script keeps running for hours.

What I have done:

<ul>
<li>aggregate with group to retrieve a list with unique <code>passid</code></li>
<li>iterate in that list for every <code>passid</code></li>
<li>use the find(<code>passid</code>) to retrieve a cursor of all the documents with the same <code>passid</code></li>
<li>do the joins and appends of the strings and lists with </li>
<li>delete the old documents</li>
<li>save the new one</li>
</ul>

As I said, it is really time-consuming. Do you know any faster way to do it? 

Here is the code:

<pre><code>passids= db.collection.aggregate({ ""$group"": {""_id"": '$passid'}})

for i in passids['result']:
    doc = {}
    doc['passid'] = i['_id']
    documents = db.collection.find({""passid"": i['_id']})
    doc['count'] = []
    doc['text'] = """"

    for d in documents:
        doc['text'] = doc['text'] + "" "" + d['text']
        doc['text'] = doc['text'] + "" "" + d['title']
        doc['count'].append(d['count'])
        db.collection.remove(d)
    db.collection.save(doc)

622,30003130,"I have a Django web server that accepts requests from clients. In addition, I have another server, written with <a href=""https://twistedmatrix.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Twisted</a>. I wrote a Twisted protocol - its server ""half"" is running on the server, and I have a very easy to use client protocol as well.

Occasionally the Django server receives requests that need to initiate a request to the Twisted server. This may obviously be a long operation, so it cannot be synchronous. I'm having trouble incorporating a Twisted client inside the Django project to make these requests.

Simplifying the architecture a bit, it looks something like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/onVHq.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">

Initially, I created a global thread instance in the views. file of my Django project that runs Twisted's reactor loop, and whenever a request was received through the Django server, I'd add it to the reactor asynchronously to be performed by that thread. This worked fine with the <code> manage. runserver</code> script, however when I ran it on my Apache server I would sometimes get the requests on the Twisted server and sometimes wouldn't.

I'm assuming this is because Apache also runs several threads, each of which tries to create that reactor-thread. Since there may only be one reactor per process, only one thread succeeds while the others fail, therefore only some requests make it through - the ones in the ""winning"" thread (this is just a theory, I haven't verified it).

I believe my options are:

<ol>
<li>Somehow share my reactor-thread instance among all Apache threads so that there's really just one reactor. Not sure exactly how to do this - everything I find online talks about sharing <strong>data</strong> (through Django's DB), not sharing instances.</li>
<li>Run the Twisted client as a separate process on the Django server machine, and send requests from Django with some RPC method (that is not Twisted-based - otherwise I'd be back in square one of running a Twisted client inside Django, which I cannot seem to be able to do...).</li>
</ol>

Any advice on what is the correct solution / how to implement it? Is there another way I'm not thinking of?

Thank you.

Which means that a working code can be rendered failure after I pasted and deleted something else!

Can anyone shed some light on this issue? Nuke is a very established software I don't know if it's a software bug.

If anyone has done this, can you please provide small code snippets so I can adapt it to my needs.

This method includes stopWords removal and it works fine. It removes any punctuation and break every word. But besides the words it returns lots of trash like single letters and numbers. 

This method though, has one parameter called ""token_pattern"" that takes a string (regex) that can give me better results. 

What i want to do is:
a) Exlude Any words that start, end or <strong>include</strong> numbers.
b) <strong>exclude</strong> any numbers from text
c) exclude <strong>any</strong> words &lt;= 2 letters
b) exclude all the http pages

<strong>text</strong> = ""It can be dangerous to take Fido for a ride: <a href=""http://t.co/eR2WfAnZBI"">http://t.co/eR2WfAnZBI</a> <a href=""http://t.co/RF3bhPNPwR"">http://t.co/RF3bhPNPwR</a>',each year, on average, 20 billion empty miles are incurred by trucks, which costs the economy billions""

671,14011470,"I have a webpage with a Flash object on it. I want to be able to click multiple different buttons within in. Regarding this method I was wondering if there is any library (preferable Python/Perl/JAVA) that can actually stream a page-open session, emulate a resolution and perform (x,y) clicks.

For example (Python-like):

I Load the SomeUrlLib:

<pre><code>import SomeUrlLib

browser = new SomeUrlLib()
browser.setUrl('http://www.someaddress.com/subpage/')
browser.setResolution(1280, 800)

browser.startBrowsing('SessionName') # Bind a session name to this browsing session
locX = 40
locY = 80
browser.click(locX, locY, 'SessionName')
screen = browser.takeScreenshot('SessionName')
</code></pre>

I'm thinking this is nearly impossible, as I can't imagine any library out there would be able to have Flash-engine build-in.

""If"" this is possible in some weird way I would like to try to use the Sikuli API (screen recognition) to maybe react on screenshot feedback to click on certain coordinates, yet I guess dynamically changing pages are still an issue due to the latency the script would have towards what happens live in the page.

I have two lists and one index to access the elements in each list. The ith position on the first list is related to the ith position on the second. I didn't use a dict because the lists are ordered.

What I was doing was something like:

<pre><code>for i in xrange(len(first_list)):
    # do something with first_list[i] and second_list[i]
</code></pre>

So, using that example, I think can make a function sort of like this:

<pre><code>#global variables first_list, second_list, i
first_list, second_list, i = None, None, 0

#initialize the lists
...

#have a function to do what the loop did and inside it increment i
def function:
    #do stuff
    i += 1

715,5207430,"Let's say we have numbers factors, for example 1260:

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; factors(1260)
[2, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7]
</code></pre>

Which would be best way to do in Python combinations with every subproduct possible from these numbers, ie all factorings, not only prime factoring, with <strong>sum of factors</strong> less than <strong>max_product</strong>?

If I do combinations from the prime factors, I have to refactor remaining part of the product as I do not know the remaining part not in combination.

I can also refine my <strong>divisors</strong> function to produce pairs of divisors instead of divisors in size order, but still it will cost me to do this for number with <strong>product upto 12000</strong>. The product must remain always the same.

I was linked to divisor routine, but it did not look worth the effort to prove them to adopt to my other code. At least my divisor function is noticably faster than sym one:

<pre><code>def divides(number):
    if number&lt;2:
        yield number
        return
    high = [number]
    sqr = int(number ** 0.5)
    limit = sqr+(sqr*sqr != number)
    yield 1
    for divisor in xrange(3, limit, 2) if (number &amp; 1) else xrange(2, limit):
        if not number % divisor:
            yield divisor
            high.append(number//divisor)
    if sqr*sqr== number: yield sqr
    for divisor in reversed(high):
        yield divisor
</code></pre>

Only problem to reuse this code is to link the divisors to factoring sieve or do some kind of itertools.product of divisors of the divisors in pairs, which I would give out as pairs instead of sorting to order.

Example results would be:

<pre><code>[4, 3, 3, 5, 7] (one replacement of two)
[5, 7, 36] (one replacement of three)
[3, 6, 14, 5] (two replacements)
</code></pre>

Probably I would need some way to produce sieve or dynamic programming solutions for smaller divisors which could be linked to numbers whose divisors they are. Looks difficult to avoid overlap though. I do have one sieve function ready which stores biggest prime factor for each number for speeding up the factoring without saving complete factorings of every number... maybe it could be adapted.

<strong>UPDATE: The sum of factors should be near the product, so probably there is high number of factors of &lt;= 10 in answer (upto 14 factors).</strong>

<strong>UPDATE2:</strong>
Here is my code, but must figure out how to do multiple removals recursively or iteratively for parts > 2 long and dig up the lexical partitioning to replace the jumping bit patterns which produce duplicates (pathetic hit count only for one replacement, and that does not count the passing of 'single element partionings' inside the single_partition):

<pre><code>from __future__ import print_function
import itertools
import operator
from euler import factors

def subset(seq, mask):
    """""" binary mask of len(seq) bits, return generator for the sequence """"""
    # this is not lexical order, replace with lexical order masked passing duplicates
    return (c for ind,c in enumerate(seq) if mask &amp; (1&lt;&lt;ind))


def single_partition(seq, n = 0, func = lambda x: x):
    ''' map given function to one partition  '''
    for n in range(n, (2**len(seq))):
        result = tuple(subset(seq,n))
        others = tuple(subset(seq,~n))
        if len(result) &lt; 2 or len(others) == 0:
            #empty subset or only one or all
            continue
        result = (func(result),)+others
        yield result


if __name__=='__main__':
    seen,  hits, count = set(), 0, 0
    for f in single_partition(factors(13824), func = lambda x: reduce(operator.mul, x)):
        if f not in seen:
            print(f,end=' ')
            seen.add(f)
        else:
            hits += 1
        count += 1
    print('\nGenerated %i, hits %i' %(count,hits))
</code></pre>

<strong>REFINEMENT</strong> I am hap to get only the factorings with max 5 factors in the non-prime factor parts. I have found by hand that non-decreasing arrangements for up to 5 same factors follow this form:

<pre><code>partitions of 5    applied to 2**5
1  1  1   1  1     2  2   2   2  2
1  1  1     2      2  2   2    4
1  1  1  3         2  2      8
1   2       2      2    4      4 
1       4          2      16
  2      3           4       8
</code></pre>

<strong>THE SOLUTION</strong>
I do not remove the accepted answer from fine solution down, but it is over complicated for the job. From Project Euler I reveal only this helper function from orbifold of NZ, it works faster and without needing the prime factors first:

<pre><code>def factorings(n,k=2):
    result = []
    while k*k &lt;= n:
        if n%k == 0:
            result.extend([[k]+f for f in factorings(n/k,k)])
        k += 1
    return result + [[n]]

I am trying to list all files on a Windows shared drive (which is restricted to certain users), and later write couple of files to the shared drive.

I am using os.listdir to do this. It works well if I just run the web app on my machine, but once it's deployed on the actual server it will stop working.

The problem is the permission on the Windows shared drive. User has to login first so I do have their username and password. 

My question is how to supply os.listdir with username and password?

I tried os.listdir('//windows/share/drive/dir@domanin/username:password') but the system will try to look for the file instead of passing username and password.

Does any one know how to solve this? Or I need to map the drive (how do I map drive with credential?), list files, write files, then disconnect the mapped drive?

748,39274460,"<strong>UPDATED ISSUE</strong>

I have discovered the issue appears to be with the fact that I am using the FULLSCREEN tag to create the window. I added a rectangle to be drawn in the top left of the scree (0, 0), but when I run the program, It is mostly off the screen. Then, when I Alt-Tab away and back, the rectangle is appropriately placed at 0,0 and the turret is off center.

So basically, when the program starts, the game screen is larger than my actual screen, but centered. Then after Alt-Tab, the game screen is lined up with 0,0 but since the game screen is larger than my screen, the turret looks off center, but is actually centered relative to the game.

So the real question is why does using the FULLSCREEN tag make a screen larger than my computer screen?

<strong>ORIGINAL ISSUE</strong>

I am building a simple demonstration of a turret in the center of the screen which follows the location of the cursor as if to fire where it is. Everything works perfectly until I Alt-Tab away from the screen, and then Alt-Tab back. At this point to turret is now off center (down and to the right)

<pre><code>import game, math
game.init()

image_library = {}

screen_dimen = game.display.Info()
print(""Screen Dimensions "", screen_dimen)

def get_image(name):
    if name not in image_library:
        image = game.image.load(name)
        image_library[name] = image
    else:
        image = image_library[name]
    return image

robot_turret_image = get_image('robot_turret.png')

screen = game.display.set_mode((0, 0), game.FULLSCREEN)

done = False

clock = game.time.Clock()

while not done:
    for event in game.event.get():
        if event.type == game.QUIT:
            done = True
        if event.type == game.MOUSEMOTION:
            print(event.pos)
        if event.type == game.KEYDOWN and event.key == game.K_SPACE:
            done = True

    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
    pos = game.mouse.get_pos()
    angle = 360 - math.atan2(pos[1] - (screen_dimen.current_h / 2),
                             pos[0] - (screen_dimen.current_w / 2)) * 180 / math.pi
    rot_image = game.transform.rotate(robot_turret_image, angle)
    rect = rot_image.get_rect(center=(screen_dimen.current_w / 2, screen_dimen.current_h / 2))

    screen.blit(rot_image, rect)

    color = (0, 128, 255)
    game.draw.rect(screen, color, game.Rect(0, 0, 200, 200))

    game.display.update()
    clock.tick(60)
</code></pre>

It seems that the center is now off. I have printed out the screen dimensions before and after the Alt-Tab and they are the same, so I can't figure out why the image moves. I believe I am missing something regarding state changes with Pygame, but can't figure out what. If it is relevant, I am on Windows 10.

running <code>type(t[t &lt; 8])</code> also gives <code>ndarray</code>, which I guess should have all the properties of a num array. Should I perhaps do this better with list expressions? I have not done a timed comparison yet, but I would imagine this to be a problem for large 2D arrays.

i'm trying to implement quick sort with .

if the element of left mark is larger than pivot then i start moving the right mark to find an element smaller than pivot and then swap.
if right mark is smaller than left mark, swap pivot with the element of right mark.
then separate the list with pivot. and repeat the step

my code can separate the list into two lists as i imagined. but when it returns it somehow co the elements several times and made it wrong. i'm not familiar with recursion and can't find the problem.

791,21528970,"I am trying to store properties on a model instance of an <code>ndb.Model</code> class, so that they are ignored when writing to the datastore, but are pickled correctly so I can store in Memcache.

For example, I have the following model:-

<pre><code>from google.appengine.ext import ndb

class TestModel(ndb.Model):
    lat = ndb.FloatProperty()
    lon = ndb.FloatProperty()

    def set_lat(self, lat):

        self.lon = lon

    def set_child(self, testModel):
        setattr(self, 'child', testModel)

I was hoping that I could store this in Memcache, and when I retrieve it all the member variables would be restored. But <code>child</code> is getting lost. For a test, see the following code.

<pre><code>    # create a model and assign some props
    testModel = test_model.TestModel()
    testModel.set_lat(55.55)
    testModel.set_lon(-0.565)

    # get from memcache
    fromCacheModel = memcache.get(key)

    # here fromCacheModel.child does not exist??
</code></pre>

The model retrieved from Memcache has no <code>child</code> property. 

This works with <code>db.Model</code>, but not with <code>ndb.Model</code>. The reason I would like to do it, is so I can 
store fully formed objects in Memcache for quicker retrieval (less rpc calls).

806,7687090,"I'm using a class called customDialog, based on Based on <a href=""http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-dialog-windows.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/tkinter-dialog-windows.htm</a>
The standard code creates a class which subclasses Toplevel, and creates modal dialogs.
I'm trying to adapt the code so it can also create modeless dialogs. 
The standard code calls the Toplevel constructor, creates the dialog and then does  self.wait_window(self)<br>
at the end, which waits until the dialog window is dismissed.
But I'm not succeeding. My naive attempt was to simply skip the wait_window() (that's the attempt in my code snipped below). I've tried a few other things, but the dialog remains modal, that is, I can't interact with the application's main window. What is forcing it to be modal? The dialogs contain widgets and a few buttons, typically.

<pre><code>class Dialog(Toplevel):

807,15447130,"In my code, I need to be able to open and close a device properly, and therefore see the need to use a context manager. While a context manager is usually defined as a class with <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code> methods, there also seem to be the possibility to decorate a function for use with the context manager (see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15427361/how-to-use-the-context-manager-to-avoid-the-use-of-del-in-/15427892?noredirect=1#15427892"">a recent post</a> and <a href=""http://preshing.com/20110920/the--with-statement-by-example"" rel=""nofollow"">another nice example here</a>).

In the following (working) code snippet, I have implemented the two possibilities; one just need to swap the commented line with the other one:

<pre><code>import time
import contextlib

def device():
    return 42

@contextlib.contextmanager
def wrap():
    print(""open"")
    yield device
    print(""close"")

        print(""open"")
        return device

#with wrap() as mydevice:
with Wrap() as mydevice:
    while True:
        time.sleep(1)
        print mydevice()

What I try is to run the code and stop it with <code>CTRL-C</code>. When I use the <code>Wrap</code> class in the context manager, the <code>__exit__</code> method is called as expeced (the text 'close' is printed in the terminal), but when I try the same thing with the <code>wrap</code> function, the text 'close' is not printed to the terminal. 

My question: Is there a problem with the code snippet, am I missing something, or why is the line <code>print(""close"")</code> not called with the decorated function?

810,2633900,"So I'm going through the beginning stages of producing a game in Python, and I'm looking for a library that is able to manipulate pixels and blit them relatively fast.

My first thought was game, as it deals in pure 2D surfaces, but it only allows pixel access through <code>game.get_at()</code>, <code>game.set_at()</code> and <code>game.get_buffer()</code>, all of which lock the surface each time they're called, making them slow to use. I can also use  the <code>PixelArray</code> and <code>surfarray</code> classes, but they are locked for the duration of their lifetimes, and the only way to blit them to a surface is to either co the pixels to a new surface, or use <code>surfarray.blit_array</code>, which requires creating a subsurface of the screen and blitting it to that, if the array is smaller than the screen (if it's bigger I can just use a slice of the array, which is no problem).

I don't have much experience with PyOpenGL or Pyglet, but I'm wondering if there is a faster library for doing pixel manipulation in, or if there is a faster method, in Pygame, for doing pixel manupilation. I did some work with SDL and OpenGL in C, and I do like the idea of adding vertex/fragment shaders to my program.

My program will chiefly be dealing in loading images and writing/reading to/from surfaces.

822,1895350,"I'm having an interesting problem with threads and the tempfile module in Python. Something doesn't appear to be getting cleaned up until the threads exit, and I'm running against an open file limit. (This is on OS X 10.5.8, Python 2.5.1.)

Yet if I sort of replicate what the tempfile module is doing (not all the security checks, but just generating a file descriptor and then using os.fdopen to produce a file object) I have no problems.

Before filing this as a bug with Python, I figured I'd check here, as it's much more likely that I'm doing something subtly wrong. But if I am, a day of trying to figure it out hasn't gotten me anywhere.

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong? Is this a bug in Python, or am I being bone-headed?

<strong>UPDATE 2009-12-14:</strong>
I think I've found the answer, but I don't like it. Since nobody was able to replicate the problem, I went hunting around our office for machines. It passed on everything except my machine. I tested on a Mac with the same software versions I was using. I even went hunting for a Desktop G5 with the EXACT same hardware and software config I had -- same result. Both tests (with tempfile and without tempfile) succeeded on everything.

For kicks, I downloaded Python 2.6.4, and tried it on my desktop, and same pattern on my system as Python 2.5.1: tempfile failed, and notempfile succeeded.

This is leading me to the conclusion that something's hosed on my Mac, but I sure can't figure out what. Any suggestions are welcome.

824,26893150,"So I'm pretty new to Flask and I'm trying to make my mind around one thing. So, if I understand well when you write a function within a Flask app and you use the @app.route decorator in that function, it only runs when you hit that path/url.

I have a small oauth app written in Flask that goes through all the authorization flow and then it return the token. 

My question is how do I get that token from the @decorated function? For example, lets say I have something like this:

<pre><code>@app.route(/token/)
def getToken(code): #code from the callback url.
    #/Stuff to get the Token/
    #/**********************/
    return token
</code></pre>

If I hit the (/token/) url-path the function returns the token. But now I need to get that token and use it in another function to write and read from the API I just got the token from. My initial thought was doing this:

<pre><code>token = getToken(code)
</code></pre>

But if I do that, I get this error: 

<pre><code>RuntimeError: working outside of request context

So again, my question is, how do I get the token so I can pass it as a parameter to other functions.

838,27300330,"I have this string:

</code></pre>

I want to break it apart so I get <code>[label, label2, amount, units]</code>.

<ul>
<li><code>label</code> is the name ie, <code>vitamin c</code> and can contain unicode characters</li>
<li><code>label2</code> is <code>min|max</code> depending on the particular string.</li>
<li><code>amount</code> is the numerical amount listed (can include commas or decimals)</li>
<li><code>units</code> can include unicode characters</li>
</ul>

You can see some edge cases cropping up already:

<ul>
<li>Some ingredients don't contain a <code>label2</code> = <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> (see <code>copper</code> and <code>vitamin c</code>). The regex grouping can be <code>None</code> in this case.</li>
<li>Some ingredients have <code>label2</code> mispelled (see <code>vitamin e</code> uses <code>mon</code>)</li>
<li>There may be unicode in the units</li>
</ul>

Ideally, I would like a regex that can match against individual ingredients as well as a messy list (like I have provided).

I came up with:

<pre><code>import re
regex = re.compile(ur'([a-z 0-9]+)(min|max|mon)?[. ]+([0-9., ]+)((?=[%])|[a-z/]+|[^\W\d_]+/[^\W\d_]+)', re.UNICODE)


re.findall(regex, s)

# [(u'vitamin a min', u'', u'14,053 ', u'iu/kg'), (u'   vitamin c', u'', u'13,000', u'iu/kg'), (u' vitamin d max', u'', u'10,000', u'\u03bc/kg'), (u' copper', u'', u'1', u'mg/kg'), (u' vitamin e mon 10', u'', u'00', u'iu/kg')]

re.findall(regex, u'vitamin a min. 14,053 iu/kg')

# [(u'vitamin a min', u'', u'14,053 ', u'iu/kg')]
</code></pre>

This matches nearly everything, but you can see some problems.

<ul>
<li>the <code>label</code> is matching the <code>min</code>,<code>max</code> and <code>label2</code> matches nothing.</li>
<li>I don't like hardcoding <code>(min|max|mon)</code> because there could be a case where the word is misspelled to something else and that hardcoding won't catch it.</li>

839,32541120,"I got a csv file with a couple of columns and a header containing 4 rows. The first column contains the timestamp. Unfortunately it also gives milliseconds, but whenever those are at 00, they are not given in the file. It looks like that:

<pre><code>""TOA5"",""CR1000"",""CR1000"",""E9048""
""TIMESTAMP"",""RECORD"",""BattV_Avg"",""PTemp_C_Avg""
""TS"",""RN"",""Volts"",""Deg C""

""2015-08-28 13:12:22"",3,12.91,32.54
</code></pre>

As I don't need the milliseconds, I want to get rid of those, as this makes further calculations containing time a bit complicated. My approach so far:

Extract first 20 digits in each row to get a format such as <code>2015-08-28 12:40:23</code>

<pre><code>timestamp = []
with open(filepath) as f:
    for _ in xrange(4): #skip 4 header rows
        next(f)
    for line in f:
        time = line[1:20] #Get values for the current line
        timestamp.append(time) #Add values to list
</code></pre>

From here on I'm struggling on how to procede further. I want to exchange the first column in the csv file with the newly created <code>timestamp</code> list.

I tried creating a dictionary, but I don't know how to use the header caption in row 2 as the key:

<pre><code>d = {}
with open(filepath, 'rb') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
    for col in csv_reader:
        #use header info from row 2 as key here
</code></pre>

This would import the whole csv file into a dict and I'd then change the TIMESTAMP entry in the dict with the <code>timestamp</code> list above. Is this even possible?

Or is there an easier approach on how to just change the first column in the csv with my new list so that my csv file in the end contains the timestamp just without the millisecond information?

So the first column in my csv should look like this:

<pre><code>""TOA5""
""TIMESTAMP""
""TS""
""""

As a result, the program continues to work despite receiving SIGINT. Of course, I can define my own handler for SIGINT that sets a global variable sigint_received to True, and then often check the value of the variable in my program. But this looks ugly.

Is there an elegant and reliable way to make sure that the  program gets interrupted after receiving SIGINT?

In fact:

However, I don't know how I can subtract the elements in a list to the elements in another list. The way I did it, by creating another list that equals the user input minus the characters doesn't work (I tried it in my Xubuntu terminal emulator).

Pip should be installing at <code>/usr/local/lib/2.7/site-packages</code> unless i'm miss understanding something.

pip 7.1.0 from /usr/local/lib/2.7/site-packages ( 2.7)

Running <code>pip list</code> just after running <code>pip install</code> does not show the packages that were supposedly just installed by it but went to the wrong site-packages.

Adding to this, the packages installed on the <code>/lib/2.7/site-packages</code> are not recognized by my $PYTHONPATH and as such I cannot use them.

To add even more confusion, I decided to use a virtualenv, but I was amazed as even using pip with the virtualenv active kept installing to the <code>/lib/2.7/site-packages</code> instead of the virtualenv site-packages.

So, somehow I ended up with a homebrew pip, that installs packages outside of the homebrew site-packages and a  interpreter that cant use the packages installed by pip.

The first thing I tried, as suggested in the tutorial, was to comment out the <code>root.mainloop()</code> line (no go - I put the line back in).  I then removed <code>self.</code> from the event names (lines 12 &amp; 17) to see if that had any effect (nope).  I then tried putting the 2 method definitions before the <code>.bind</code> lines to see if that had any effect (nope).  I can make it work if I just use the command options, but the tutorial is on event binding, so I'm wondering why the above code will not work?

889,6039150,"I'm writing a web scraper in , using httplib2 and lxml (yes - I know I could be using scra. Let's move past that...) The scraper has about 15000 pages to parse into approximately 400,000 items. I've got the code to parse the items to run instantaneously (almost) but the portion that downloads the page from the server is still extremely slow. I'd like to overcome that through concurrency. However, I can't rely on EVERY page needing to be parsed EVERY time. I've tried with a single ThreadPool (like multiprocessing.pool, but done with threads - which should be fine since this is an I/O bound process), but I couldn't think of a graceful (or working) way of getting ALL of the threads to stop when the date of the last index item was greater than the item we were processing. Right now, I'm working on a method using two instances of ThreadPool - one to download each page, and another to parse the pages. A simplified code example is:

<pre><code>#! /usr/bin/env 2

import httplib2
from Queue import PriorityQueue
from multiprocessing.pool import ThreadPool
from lxml.html import fromstring

pages = [x for x in range(1000)]
page_queue = PriorityQueue(1000)

url = ""http://www.google.com""

def get_page(page):
    #Grabs google.com
    h = httplib2.Http("".cache"")
    resp, content = h.request(url, ""GET"")
    tree = fromstring(str(content), base_url=url)
    page_queue.put((page, tree))
    print page_queue.qsize()

def parse_page():
    page_num, page = page_queue.get()
    print ""Parsing page #"" + str(page_num)
    #do more stuff with the page here
    page_queue.task_done()

if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    collect_pool = ThreadPool()
    collect_pool.map_async(get_page, pages)
    collect_pool.close()

    parse_pool = ThreadPool()
    parse_pool.apply_async(parse_page)
    parse_pool.close()


     parse_pool.join()
     collect_pool.join()
     page_queue.join()
</code></pre>

Running this code however, doesn't do what I expect - which is to fire off two threadpools: one populating a queue and another pulling from it to parse. It begins the collect pool and runs through it and then begins the parse_pool and runs through it (I assume, I've not let the code run long enough to get to the parse_pool - the point is that collect_pool is all that seems to be running). I'm fairly sure I've messed something up with the order of the calls to join(), but I can't for the life of me figure out what order they're supposed to be in.
My question is essentially this: Am I barking up the right tree here? and if so, what the hell am I doing wrong? If I'm not - what would your suggestions be

936,37249920,"I have been wrecking my head over this the last weeks and cannot find useful information online on how I should do this. 

<strong>The Goal:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Drive several servo/RC motors <strong>wireless</strong> from one <code>pi</code> to another <code>pi</code>. </li>
<li>In essence, I want to build a <code>RC</code> remote control using a <code>pi</code>, with a second <code>pi</code>on the receiver end.</li>
</ul>

<strong>What I have done so far:</strong> 

<ul>
<li>I have been able to use the <em>serial library</em> and the Tx and Rx pins on the two Pi to successfully send serial data over a cheap 433MHz receiver/transmitter. However, I need to send over at least six pairs of two-digit numbers simultaneously(ie 12 numbers). This can be done using the serial library on the <code>pi/arduino</code>, but it causes the sample rate of the main continuous program loop to slow down to below 200Hz, which is a problem. </li>
</ul>

<strong>Next step and problems:</strong>

<ul>
<li>Since the serial data transmission is not working adequately I was thinking of embedding PWM signals directly into the RF signal. (As far as I can figure out this is how the hobby RC controllers work anyway).</li>
<li>The <code>pi</code> (as far as I know) is rubbish at sending accurate PWM signals and even worse at picking them up correctly. </li>
<li>Just to clarify I have to do this over a RF module, <strong>not</strong> over the web.</li>
</ul>

How can I do this? 

Perhaps using two Arduinos to do the transmission and receiving? 

Are there ""shields"" that I could buy?

Are there libraries that could do this for me? (<code>Pi</code> or <code>adruino</code>?)

<strong>Edited:</strong> Roland thank you for your reply

I have added the current serial transmission code. I dont think this is the most efficient way of doing it. If one transmits PWM signals with a pause between another PWM signal one can send far more data instead of just sending bits. I am not entirely sure, but I thought that is how the Remote Control RC aircraft controllers send their signals. 

Please note that the code I have inserted is a simple extract from a much larger program with several modules and a couple of hundred lines of code. I do think the few lines below are at the heart of the serial transmitter.

<pre><code>import serial

while (bProgramLoop == True):

949,32138760,"I am plottings a grading system using plot.circle. I am trying to represent the grades as label's and not numbers. E.g. as A+=1, A=2, B=3, C=4, D=5.

The points plotted on the graph is a fraction of the grades. E.g. point1 = 1.6, which would lie between A+ and A.

I could not find a way to change the labels of an axis to my represent my grades' labels, so I tried to create a second axis, a categorical axis, and hide the original axis (the one containing the grading's values.)

The problem I'm having with this approach is that my categorical axis' ticks is not lining up with original axis' ticks.
The Single interval ticker ensures that both axis number of ticks matches. but the ticks still do not align.

When I set the y_range of the original axis, the major ticks starts at the bottom of the chart and ends at the top. The categorical axis behaves differently.

951,9881440,"This is the strangest thing!  

I have a multi-threaded client application written in Python.  I'm using threading to concurrently download and process pages.  I would use the cURL multi-handle except that the bottleneck is definitely the processor (not the bandwidth) in this application so it is more efficient to use a thread pool.  

I have a 64b i7 rocking 16GB RAM.  Beefy.  I launch 80 threads while listening to Pandora and trolling Stackoverflow and BAM!  The parent process sometimes ends with the message

<code>Killed</code>

Other times a single page (which is it's own process in Chrome) will die.  Other times the whole browser crashes.  

If you want to see a bit of code here is the gist of it:

Here is the parent process:

<pre><code>def start( ):
  while True:
    for url in to_download:
      queue.put( ( url, uri_id ) )

    to_download = [ ]

    if queue.qsize( ) &lt; BATCH_SIZE:
      to_download = get_more_urls( BATCH_SIZE )

    if threading.activeCount( ) &lt; NUM_THREADS:
      for thread in threads:
        if not thread.isAlive( ):
          print ""Respawning...""
          thread.join( )
          threads.remove( thread )
          t = ClientThread( queue )
          t.start( )
          threads.append( t )

    time.sleep( 0.5 )
</code></pre>

And here is the gist of the ClientThread:

<pre><code>class ClientThread( threading.Thread ):

  def __init__( self, queue ):
    threading.Thread.__init__( self )
    self.queue = queue

  def run( self ):
    while True:
      try:
        self.url, self.url_id = self.queue.get( )
      except:
        raise SystemExit

      html = StringIO.StringIO( )
      curl = curl.Curl( )
      curl.setopt( curl.URL, self.url )
      curl.setopt( curl.NOSIGNAL, True )
      curl.setopt( curl.WRITEFUNCTION, html.write )
      curl.close( )

      try:
        curl.perform( )
      except curl.error, error:
        errno, errstr = error
        print errstr

      curl.close( )
</code></pre>

EDIT: Oh, right...forgot to ask the question...should be obvious: Why do my processes get killed?  Is it happening at the OS level?  Kernel level?  Is this due to a limitation on the number of open TCP connections I can have?  Is it a limit on the number of threads I can run at once?  The output of <code>cat /proc/sys/kernel/threads-max</code> is <code>257841</code>.  So...I don't think it's that....

I've read some articles on the subject and chose what seems like the most elegant (and easy) way to do it: signals.

I've done the following :

                self.server.setup(self)

                MainServer_thread.daemon = True
                self.server.trigger.connect(QtCore.QObject(self.printLog))
                MainServer_thread.start()

    def printLog(self, string):
        self.serverLog.append(_fromUtf8(string))

    trigger = QtCore.qtSignal(str)

    def printLog(self, message):
        print message
        self.trigger.emit(message)

But when I run my app, I get this message error :

<code>TypeError: qtSignal must be bound to a QObject, not 'instance'</code>

I first thought it was a problem with Rsyslog. So I replaced my  program with a shell one, without changing anything to the rsyslog configuration. The shell script works perfectly with rsyslog and as you can see in the code below, the script is really trivial:

<pre><code>#! /bin/sh
cat /dev/stdin &gt;&gt; /tmp/testrsyslogomoutput.txt

Since my shell script works but my Python one does not, I believe I made a mistake somewhere in my Python code but I can not find where. If you could point me to my mistake(s) that would be great.

964,18727920,"I have a <em>pandas.DataFrame</em> that won't pivot the way I expect.  While <code>pivot_table</code> properly arranges everything, the fact that it uses aggregate functions to get there is off-putting.  In addition, <code>pivot_table</code> seems to return an unnecessarily complex object rather than a flat data frame.

Consider the following example

<pre><code>import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'firstname':['Jon']*3+['Amy']*2,
                   'lastname':['Cho']*3+['Frond']*2,
                   'vehicle':['bike', 'car', 'plane','bike','plane'],
                   'weight':[81.003]*3+[65.6886]*2,
                   'speed':[29.022, 95.1144, 302.952, 27.101, 344.2],})
df.set_index(['firstname','lastname','weight'])

print('------  Unnecessary pivot_table does averaging  ------')
print(pd.pivot_table(df, values='speed',
                         rows='firstname','lastname','weight'],
                         cols='vehicle'))

print('------ pivot method dies  ------')
print(df.pivot( index=['firstname','lastname','weight'],
                columns='vehicle',
                values='speed'))
</code></pre>

The <code>pivot_table</code> results are

<pre><code>vehicle                       bike      car    plane
firstname lastname weight

Is there a way to get <code>pivot</code> to give essentially the same output as the <code>pivot_table</code> command did (but hopefully flatter and neater)?  Failing that, how do I flatten the output of <code>pivot_table</code>?  What I want as output is something more like this:

The code was written by someone else, but I had to modify it recently to add a unique identifier to the file so that existing files with the same name don't get overwritten. Essentially, I added these lines: 

<pre><code>#uid is a GUID
if os.path.isfile(destination):
            destination = os.path.splitext(destination)[0] + str(uid) + os.path.splitext(destination)[1]

I have tried <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1035340/reading-binary-file-in-"">this suggestion</a> but this does not work (the program runs forever)

This is my current setup, but I am having troubles iterating over the file:

for line in f:

The problem is that every line in the loop is a different length, and the number of lines does not correspond to the actual number of lines in the file. I am assuming Python finds, what it thinks are, end-of-line markers in the binary data, but those do not correspond to the actual ends of the lines. 

Another option I tried involves the <code>struct.unpack()</code> function to unpack line by line, since I know exactly how many bytes are on every line. 

<pre><code>import struct
unpack_str = '=?iiiiiiii...' # The actual string contains 739 i's
n_bytes = 2957 # There are 2957 bytes per line

My problem is in creating the structures on the Python side so that I can call the C-library functions.  Some of the structs in the .so library have hundreds of fields, so I was hoping there was an easier alternative to spelling out all the fields and types in a Python ctypes <code>Structure</code> object.

I would like to be able to write something like this is Python:

my_ptr = pointer(my_input)  ## wrap the input with a pointer
result = lib.my_lib_func(my_ptr)  ## call .so function with struct

This would allow me to easily replicate at least the structure definitions of the large C structs without having to create and maintain lengthy Python versions of the struct definitions.  Is this possible?  Or is there another way to achieve the same effect?

My program is going to update <code>A1</code> on <code>file1.xlsx</code> and read the data on <code>A3</code>. For example, calling <code>updateFile(5)</code> will update <code>A1</code> to <code>5</code>, and perhaps giving me <code>7</code> on <code>A3</code>. 

Unfortunately, after <code>updateFile(5)</code> is called, <code>readFile()</code> will gives <code>= A1 + A2</code> as output, instead of <code>7</code>. 

This is mainly because the data on Excel file is updated but not saved. And if I want to let <code>readFile()</code> to output <code>7</code>, I have to open <code>file1.xlsx</code> manually, Save it, and Close it.

Are there anyway or am I misusing read/write on openxl to resolve this issues? I believe I had not Save the file properly or I have to figure a way to open, save, close an Excel file programmatically.

Why does  prefix a list object with <code>s</code> when it prints to my terminal from a <code>.</code> script, but not when I'm in the  shell?

For example, if I make a short  program and execute it from the command line,

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env 
my_path=""/data/user""
print(my_path.strip().split(""/""))
</code></pre>

it outputs this: <code>s['', 'data', 'user']</code>

However, if I open the  shell and execute the same code, the <code>s</code> prefix disappears. Why is this, and can anyone link a resource to explain what is going on?

Context: I am working on a class project, and was assigned the database team. I have very little experience with MySQL and was partnered up with someone that claims to have a ton of experience with MySQL and Java. This is the function he created for Insert, Select, Update and Delete. Every function I have created that uses one of these functions has had errors, and requires modification of this original runQuery function. The main thing I have been trying to work with is the ""insert"" command. I have to be able to create a User, Admin, or a Class (like a college class), and insert the appropriate information(names, userNames, passwords, tableID). I can create a user or admin without generating an error, but when I create a class, I get an error: <a href=""http://imgur.com/g99Ru6h"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/g99Ru6h</a>

    try
    {
        runQuery(""INSERT"", ""Users"", keys, vals, null, null, 0, 30);
    }catch(Exception e)
    {
        e.printStackTrace();
        System.out.println(e);
        return false;
    }

    return true;

public boolean createClass(int classID, String name, int adminID, String institution, String meetTimes)

    String[] keys = {""ClassID"", ""ClassName"", ""AdminID"", ""Institution"", ""MeetTimes""};
    String[] vals = {Integer.toString(classID), name, Integer.toString(adminID), institution, meetTimes};

    try
    {
        runQuery(""INSERT"", ""Classes"", keys, vals, null, null, 0, 30);
    }catch(Exception e)
    {

        return false;
    }

    return true;

TL;DR: I am having trouble inserting new 'classes' into a table, and think the error relates back to the runQuery function. I have omitted the rest of the runQuery function for now, as I don't think its necessary for this problem, but I can add it in its entirety of 241 lines. Based on what I am seeing online in regards to this situation, preparedStatements seem like a much easier way to input info, no?

1024,13436440,"I'd like to report custom problems for Java files to the Problems View of Eclipse and provide Quick Fixes for them.

The standard way to do is to use the extension point <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.markers</code> to declare a custom marker and add markers by calling <code>org.eclipse.core.resources.IResource.createMarker(String)</code>. Then, one can use the extension point <code>org.eclipse.ui.ide.markerResolution</code> to provide a Quick Fix for the custom markers.

The above approach is a language-independent method of creating and resolving resource markers. The downside is that I have to write some boilerplate code to resolve my custom Java problems. Instead, I'd like to be reuse <code>IQuickFixProcessor</code>. That is, I'd like to resolve my custom Java markers using the extension point <code>org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickFixProcessors</code>. Using this extension point, I no longer have to parse the Java file in which the marker is found, I don't have to build the bindings and find the AST node covering the marker. If I don't reuse <code>org.eclipse.jdt.internal.ui.text.correction.CorrectionMarkerResolutionGenerator</code> and its dependencies, I'll end up duplicating most of it.

How can I provide Quick Fixes for my custom Java markers using the JDT infrastructure?

<strong>Attempt 1:</strong>

I defined my custom marker as follows:

<pre><code>&lt;extension
  id=""custom.marker""
  name=""Custom Java Problem""
  point=""org.eclipse.core.resources.markers""&gt;
    &lt;super type=""org.eclipse.jdt.core.problem""/&gt;
    &lt;super type=""org.eclipse.core.resources.problemmarker""/&gt;
    &lt;super type=""org.eclipse.core.resources.textmarker""/&gt;
    &lt;persistent value=""true""/&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

Then, I added instances of the above marker by invoking method <code>IResource.createMarker(""custom.marker"")</code>.

Next, I defined a custom Quick Fix processor.

<pre><code>&lt;extension
  point=""org.eclipse.jdt.ui.quickFixProcessors""&gt;
  &lt;quickFixProcessor
    class=""quickfixes.CustomQuickFixProcessor""
    id=""quickfixes.quickFixProcessor""&gt;
  &lt;/quickFixProcessor&gt;
&lt;/extension&gt;
</code></pre>

My custom markers show up in the Problems View of Eclipse, but when I right-click on a custom problem, the Quick Fix menu item is disabled.

<strong>Attempt 2:</strong>

I repalced <code>IMarker marker = resource.createMarker(""custom.marker"");</code> by <code>IMarker marker = resource.createMarker(IJavaModelMarker.JAVA_MODEL_PROBLEM_MARKER);</code>. As a result of this change, when I right-click on a custom problem in the Problems View, the Quick Fix menu item becomes available, but, when I select it, a dialog pops up that says there is no fix available for the selected problem. However, I verified that <code>CustomQuickFixProcessor.hasCorrections(ICompilationUnit, int)</code> gets called and returns <code>true</code>, but, <code>CustomQuickFixProcessor.getCorrections(IInvocationContext, IProblemLocation[])</code> doesn't get invoked.

<strong>Attempt 3:</strong>

Attempt 3 is a continuation of Attempt 2. I set the <code>IJavaModelMarker.ID</code> of the custom marker as follows:

<pre><code>marker.setAttribute(IJavaModelMarker.ID, IProblem.ExternalProblemFixable);
</code></pre>

Consequently, <code>CustomQuickFixProcessor.getCorrections</code> gets called when I hover over my custom marker in the editor or click on the light-build on the left margin of the Java editor. However, when I select the marker in the Problems View, right-click on the marker, and select the Quick Fix menu item, <code>CustomQuickFixProcessor.getCorrections</code> doesn't get called and a dialog appears saying that no Quick Fixes are available.

I ran JDT in debug mode to see why it doesn't call <code>CustomQuickFixProcessor.getCorrections</code> when I invoke the Quick Fix from the Problems View. It turned out <code>CorrectionMarkerResolutionGenerator.internalGetResolutions(IMarker)</code> finds no resolutions because <code>CorrectionMarkerResolutionGenerator.hasProblem (context.getASTRoot().getProblems(), location)</code> doesn't find the custom problem in the AST of the compilation unit. I'm not sure how to associate my custom markers with the AST of the compilation unit.

1026,10710820,"I'm using a  linear algebra library (ojalgo 32.0) for scala project, and I've encountered a
strange problem. Every ojalgo method I've used works fine (e.g., matrix
and element-wise multiplication, inverse, and random matrix
generation) except for two seemingly simple ones for getting matrix dimensions. I've never had any
trouble calling  libraries before, and I'm pretty curious about
what's going on. Here's some example code in , which works fine:

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] arg) {
  MatrixFactory tmpFactory = PrimitiveMatrix.FACTORY;
  BasicMatrix wMat = tmpFactory.makeRandom(5,5,new Weibull(5.0, 2.0));
  System.out.println(wMat.getColDim());
}

A simple translation to scala (using version 2.9.2):

<pre><code>object DataGen {
  def main(args:Array[String]):Unit = {
  val tmpFactory = PrimitiveMatrix.FACTORY
  val wMat = tmpFactory.makeRandom(5,5,new Weibull(5.0, 2.0))
  println(wMat.getColDim)
}

The scala code throws this:

   at DataGen.main(DataGen.scala)
</code></pre>

Line 11 is 

<pre><code>println(wMat.getColDim).
</code></pre>

Searching for other cases of this error indicates that there are some known issues with access errors in scala, but I'm still not sure what cause of the problem or the cleanest workaround might be.

    Collections.sort(myList, new Comparator&lt;? super MyInterface&gt;() {
        ...
    });
}
</code></pre>

and got a compile time error,

<pre><code>The type new Comparator(){} cannot extend or implement Comparator&lt;? super MyInterface&gt;
A supertype may not specify any wildcard.
</code></pre>

So, I changed it to:

<pre><code>static void mySort(List&lt;? extends MyInterface&gt; myList, SortCriteria mySortCriteria) {
    Collections.sort(myList, new Comparator&lt;MyInterface&gt;() {
        ...
    });
}
</code></pre>

And it compiles and works. Any good explanations?

As assylias pointed out, IDEA was just complaining and the code ran without problem,
I still had problems with the same code in IDEA 13 since streams.add expected a function that returns Stream and List::stream returns Stream. To solve it I ended up using the following code:

<pre><code>List&lt;Person&gt; personList = getPersons();
List&lt;Supplier&lt;Stream&lt;Person&gt;&gt;&gt; streams = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();
streams.add(personList::stream);

1040,2334380,"I'm writing a piece of  software that has to make the final judgement on the similarity of two documents encoded in UTF-8.

The two documents are very likely to be the same, or slightly different from each other, because they have many features in common like date, location, creator, etc., but their text is what decides if they really are.

I expect the text of the two documents to be either very similar or not at all, so I can be rather strict about the threshold to set for similarity. For example I could say that the two documents are similar only if they have 90% of their words in common, but I would like to have something more robust, which would work for texts short and long alike.

To sum it up I have:

<ul>
<li>two documents, either very similar or not similar at all, but:</li>
<li>it is more likely for the two documents to be similar than not</li>
<li>documents can be both long (some paragraphs) and short (a few sentences)</li>
</ul>

I've experimented with <a href=""http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/~sam/simmetrics.html"" rel=""nofollow"">simmetrics</a>, which has a large array of string matching function, but I'm most interested in suggestion about possible algorithms to use.

Possible candidates I have are:

<ul>
<li>Levenshtein: its output is more significant for short texts</li>
<li>overlapping coefficient: maybe, but will it discriminate well for documents of different lenght?</li>
</ul>

Also considering two texts similar only when they are exactly the same would not work well, because I'd like for documents that differ only for a few words to pass the similarity test.

One of the post mentions using <code>&lt;xsl:param name=""f2"" as=""document-node()""/&gt;</code> but how to specify multiple files?

<strong>Update</strong>:
I am unable to post an answer so just editing my question - 

Finally figured it out.....

I use MapForce and am not terribly familiar with xslt so I can't explain the expression below too much but conceptually I did this - 

I used a comma separated string (containing list of files) as input which is then tokenized.

<pre><code>&lt;xsl:param name=""listOfFiles"" as=""xs:string"" required=""yes""/&gt;

&lt;xsl:for-each select=""tokenize($listOfFiles, replace(',', '(\.|\$|\^|\{|\[|\(|\||\)|\*|\+|\?|\\)', '\\$1'))""&gt;
</code></pre>

for my  code - 

<pre><code>t.setParameter(""listOfFiles"", ""file1.xml,file2.xml"");
</code></pre>

1044,4315300,"I am trying to unload a dll in . I have read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/453359/how-to-unload-dll-from--jvm"">this</a> and <a href=""http://codethesis.com/tutorial.php?id=1"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> but it seems that you can not guarantee that the dll will actually be unloaded at a certain time. This is because System.gc() simply ""asks kindly"" for the garbage collector to run.

So here is a break down of the situation. I have a dll that provides some functionality via JNI. Lets call this dll MainDll. MainDll is loaded from a call to System.load(""MainDll""). I need to be able to unload and load this dll on the fly.

Is it possible to create another dll that's sole purpose is to load and unload MainDll. Lets call this dll LoaderDll. I could then simple call System.load(""LoaderDll"") and have some native functions to load and unload MainDll. The reason for doing this, is I have access to functions on the native system that can load and unload the dll on the fly. The tricky part with this is, will I have still be able to access the native functions I have written in MainDll if it loaded from inside LoaderDll.

Sorry if this is a confusing question. It seems its a little difficult to explain.

Thanks

The MessageWindow class contain the Jframe which has text area. The Jframe is shown whenever data is available on the port, but the text area is not being populated. Even debugging didn't help.

I think the problem would be in attaining the textArea reference. Maybe the reference to textArea is different from what we want to set the text.

1063,22456450,"I am trying to mock a class which is actually not part of test program. i.e. 
My test program TestA.helloTest() calls class A's method hello() and A.hello() calls class B's greetings(). 

TestA.helloTest() -> A.hello() -> B.greetings()

I'd like my class A to use a mock object for B instead of actual implementation as it some security stuff which is not relevant to test programs objective. 

There are several classes like B exists in code and probably we cannot get to modify them due to its sensitive nature. The problem is, class B is neither part of dependency injection nor implements any interface. I know its a bad practice, this code was written almost when I was kindergarden. :)

I think we can inject mock only within the context of test program. Is there a way to make class A uses a mock object for class B (or C, D, E) instead of its actual implementation by negotiating with JVM or Mockito ?

I'd appreciate any thoughts/inputs.

1075,20435840,"I had a project in Android in which i made something like a shopping list app that would print to a receipt thermal printer.
The way i designed the receipt was simple : i created an .xml layout in which i added 1 linear layout for the header,3 vertical linearlayouts for the columns and another for the footer.After that i would just programmatically add text to the layouts and then send the .xml to printing.
It was great,i could set the font easily,move stuff easily,add images,logos,anything.

Now,i know i can use graphics2d and print GUI components,i tested that with a textarea and it works great.It even scrolls when you have like 100 lines,unlike with jframes where it only prints what it sees.

My issue is that i need 3-4 columns of text.Something like this :

<pre><code>1. Bananas         4     11.20$
2. Toilet paper    12    3.99$
3. Donuts          1     0.49$
</code></pre>

I could just add this to the text area and print it but the problem is that the length of the text will vary and the text will be all messy and uneven.

So,how can i do something like in android : add 3-4 columns to which i can add text and even if they have 100 lines the printer will successfully print all of them an not the ones you can see without scrolling down ?

Thanks in advance and have a nice day !

I am using a custom class to get data from a SQLite database. 

For example:

Each user in the USER table has a column with id of the department he belongs to. 

At the moment I am getting all the users and then comparing their department IDs to the targetID of the department I am looking for. 
Is there a way to get just the set of users that have a particular department ID, so that I don't have to check each one's department id?

1079,39883210,"Consider the following book entity and an author entity that is omitted
because it does not matter:

<pre><code>@Entity class Book {
    @Id private Long id;
    @Version private Integer version;
    @ManyToMany private Collection&lt;Authors&gt; authors;
    // getters and setters 
}
</code></pre>

The following DTO is used to transfer data to the view:

<pre><code>class BookDto {
    private Long id;
    private Integer version;
    private Collection&lt;Authors&gt; authors;Â´
    // getters and setters  
}
</code></pre>

<strong>And now a simple requirement:</strong> If an author of a book is added/removed, the 
version field should increment in order to indicate a change by the user.

So here is my approach. First load the entity that should be edited:

<pre><code>// transaction starts 
// force increment is needed because book entity is not 
// changed when authors are added/removed, right?
Book book = em.find(Book.class, id, LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT); 
// [PLACEHOLDER] What to do here? flush, clear, transaction commit?
BookDto dto = new BookDto();
dto.setId(book.getId());
dto.setVersion(book.getVersion()); // PROBLEM: still old 
// version as forced increment only occurs after transaction commits
dto.setAuthors(book.getAuthors());
// send dto to view and let user edit it, transaction commits
</code></pre>

And when the DTO returns from the view:

<pre><code>// edited dto returns from view, transaciton starts 
Book book = em.find(Book.class, dto.getId())
em.detatch(book);
book.setVersion(dto.getVersion()); // only possible when detached, right?
book.setAuthors(dto.getAuthors());
em.merge(book);
// transaction commits
</code></pre>

This results in a optimistic lock exception. The only way to make this work is a <strong>transaction commit</strong> at <code>[PLACEHOLDER]</code>. But is this the way to implement optimistic locking with forced increment? And if so, how cold this work with container managed transactions?  

(You might disagree with the design choice to map the entity into a dto before sending it to the view, but this is a different story.)

My instructor told us that we had to use a 'Triple nested loop' which I assume is just a for loop inside a for loop inside a for loop...I get all the up to the point where I need to store the strings in an array in which case I cannot and have not found another way around.

1095,32238980,"Within two statements that have drastically shortened my code I need to add a statement that adds the text of a JButton to a StringBuilder. The ActionListener statement exists to disable the JButtons when clicked (a nice aesthetic), but I want to include if possible the ability to append the StringBuilder within the ActionListener as well. The following is the two parts of this code.

<pre><code>theModel.randomLetters();

    ActionListener disableButton = new ActionListener() {
        @Override
        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
            if (!(event.getSource() instanceof JButton)) {

The .addActionListener(disableButton) adds the above ActionListener to each button when it is produced by the for loop. However,

</code></pre>

is what I thought would properly append the StringBuilder ""currentWord"" with whatever value the clicked button holds (hence ""((JButton)event.getSource())""). There are no errors per say but I have written separate lines of code in my main class to test whether there are any changes to the StringBuilder when any buttons are clicked. There isn't.

Where and what do I need to do to properly add the value of the clicked JButton to currentWord?

1096,8568690,"What are commonly used ways to build web forms in Java and Groovy?

Spring and Grails provide corresponding taglibs, but I am wondering whether there are form frameworks, which allow to create forms as sets of objects, dynamically manipulate the elements, embed sub-forms, populate and validate, and render.

For example, if I have a group of fields common for a number of forms, I would like to reuse the code. Furthermore, such a group of elements, in turn, may be a part of another group. I also would like to dynamically reorder the elements, change field names and other input field attributes, and so on without altering any HTML code.

1101,4964020,"We have a Maven build (version 2.2.1) that currently produces a WAR file. Our output directory is <code>target/</code>, so we end up with a build artifact <code>target/MyWar.WAR</code>.

I'm adding two profiles to our POM.xml file to facilitate specific build ""flavors"" that each require a specific version of an <code>A.xml</code> file. In the intermediate build directory <code>target/MyWar/</code> there are 3 files:

<pre><code>A.xml
A_1.xml
A_2.xml
</code></pre>

Building in Maven without a specified profile should use A.xml, and it does currently. I want to use <code>maven-antrun-plugin</code> to (for Profile 1) replace A.xml with A_1.xml, and for Profile 2 replace A.xml with A_2.xml. (Removing the _1 and _2 suffixes.)

This is an example of Profile 1's execution:

This correctly replaces the files in the intermediate target/MyWar/ directory, but for whatever reason the final WAR that's being produced in <code>target</code> does <strong>not</strong> reflect these changes.

It's as if running in the 'package' phase is too late, and the WAR has already been built. Changing the phase to 'compile' or 'test', the immediately-previous phases, complain because the A.xml file (and the intermediate build directory) have not even been created yet.

The <a href=""http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/api/cern/colt/list/DoubleArrayList.html"" rel=""nofollow"">DoubleArrayList</a> in the Colt library provides methods like shuffle() but not sum() or average. 

The fastutil <a href=""http://fastutil.dsi.unimi.it/docs/it/unimi/dsi/fastutil/doubles/DoubleArrayList.html"" rel=""nofollow"">DoubleArrayList</a> also does not provide sum() or average(). 

Is there some library which provides sum() or average()?

<li>Fallback to download page if incorrect Java version is found (eg pre 1.5).</li>
<li>Loading page for both Java VM start period and while the Jar is downloaded (ideally a custom splash screen with a progress bar).</li>

Questions have been asked before: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/985754/how-to-deploy-a--applet-for-todays-browsers-applet-embed-object"">how to deploy</a>, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/719712/how-can-i-check-if-i-have-that--6-plugin-2-for-applets-installed"">check for 1.6</a>, and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/383510/is-there-any-plugin-framework-for--applets"">Plugin framework</a>. None of these fully answer my question. I am also not considering web start or Java FX.

My current solution is to include an additional small test applet compiled for Java 1.1. If Java pre-1.5 is found it redirects the page to the failure page. If no Java is found the page asks the user to visit .com. This works acceptably, but is poor because it requires an additional applet and doesn't show anything while the VM is starting.

Chainsaw could maybe be an option but is currently not compatible with logback which I use for technical reasons.

Is there any project with stand alone viewers or embedded in an IDE which would be suitable for this kind of log handling.

It went from around 10 ms for creation of single objects at smaller db sizes to about 100 ms for creation of single objects with a thousand nodes in the db. 

This kind of lag won't work for my project and, honestly, at that size it shouldn't be happening I wouldn't think. I have done my research and can't seem to find too much that helped. I have found mentions of speed differences between Cypher and the Java core API, but have tried both and can't seem to get the speed any better. I was also thinking maybe there was too much transaction overhead, but I don't think that's the case since it doesn't seem to be a problem with the smaller database sizes.

Hey guys, this is for one of my classes. There are two classes (listed above), Thing2 and Test10. This is the output, but I don't understand how to get to the output (i.e. what points to what and what's the order everything gets resolved in?). Thanks!

why the <code>factors</code>, <code>lastFactors</code> arrays are cloned? Can't it be simply written as <code>factors = lastFactors;</code> and <code>lastFactors = factors;</code>? Just because the <code>factors</code> is a local variable and it is then passed to <code>encodeIntoResponse</code>, which can modify it?

Hope the question is clear. Thanks.

1127,37303790,"I want to simulate a race between threads, but some of the threads do not start. How can I implement the run method in such a way that every Competitor Thread increments a Counter and when the counter reaches value 100 the winner thread is announce in the RaceContext. There are 10 teams with 4 ThreadCompetitors in each of them... This is what I've done so far :

race class:

<pre><code>public class RelayRace {
    private List&lt;RelayRaceTeam&gt; teamList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(10);

    public RelayRace() {
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""FERRARI""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""BMW""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""LAMBORGHINI""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""DACIA""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""NASCAR""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""OPEL""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""MITSUBISHI""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""HONDA""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""PORSCHE""));
        teamList.add(new RelayRaceTeam(""MERCEDES""));

    }

    public void start() {
        teamList.forEach(RelayRaceTeam::start);
    }
}
</code></pre>

TeamClass:

<pre><code>public class RelayRaceTeam extends Thread {
    private static final ThreadRaceContext context = new ThreadRaceContext();
    private ArrayList&lt;RelayRaceCompetitor&gt; competitors = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(4);
    private String name;

    public RelayRaceTeam(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
            competitors.add(new RelayRaceCompetitor());
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {

        competitors.forEach(RelayRaceCompetitor::start);

        for (RelayRaceCompetitor competitor : competitors) {
            System.out.println(""Competitor "" + competitor.getNumber() + "" from team "" +
                    name + "" has traversed "" + Count.getCounter());
        }

        if (Count.getCounter() == 100) {
            synchronized (context) {
                context.announceWhichTeamWon(name, competitors);
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

Competitor:

<pre><code>public class RelayRaceCompetitor extends Thread{
    private int number;
    private static final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);

    public RelayRaceCompetitor() {
        number = count.getAndIncrement();
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        Count.increment();
    }

    public int getNumber() {
        return number;
    }
}
</code></pre>

The context where the winner is announced :

<pre><code>public class ThreadRaceContext extends Thread {
    public void announceWhichTeamWon(String name, ArrayList&lt;RelayRaceCompetitor&gt; competitors) {
        System.out.println(name + "" won the competition"");
        for (RelayRaceCompetitor competitor : competitors) {
            System.out.println(""Competitor number : "" + competitor.getNumber());
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

And the counter :

<pre><code>public class Count {
    private static int counter = 1;

    public static void increment() {
        counter++;
    }

    public static int getCounter() {
        return counter;

1128,33511460,"I was wondering what will happen in this situation: I have 10 threads waiting (using <code>wait</code>) on some <code>lockObject</code> and 1 thread (lets call it <code>X</code> thread) trying to enter a synchronized by <code>lockObject</code> block.

But in practice I tried this and <code>X</code> thread is executed always last.

1131,11850280,"I have implemented simple proxy server using Java NIO channels, but have a problem, some sites works perfectly, but other give an error about unknown path or redirect on technical page of its hoster with message the resource doesn't exist. Is it my fault or may be some sites don`t allow proxy?

ProxyServer works as this: I enter 'localhost' and in browser I recive site that was set in code. And request from browser I simply resend on target site at such way:

<pre><code>private void connect(SelectionKey key) throws IOException {
    SocketChannel channel = ((SocketChannel) key.channel());
    Attachment attachment = (Attachment) key.attachment();
    channel.write(attachment.buffer);
}
</code></pre>

So 'key' - is SelectionKey of target site and in attachment.buffer I store request that was send to proxy server.

So, something worng with my code or its just closed opportunity to proxy by sites?

<strong>Update 1.</strong> I suppose, I found a problem. Cause I redirect request from localhost to remote server AS IS so in request in field HOST I have 'localhost'. It seems like some sites ignore this fields, other try to use and redirect to 404 page, cause can't find 'localhost' I`m asking for. So question is how to change field 'Host' in request on destination server name?

If you can observe the output has changed.Especially in the last two lines of the above output where the ""key entry is the path"" and ""value entry is the hash "". I am unable to figure out an exact reason why the hashmap is giving a weird output.I am expecting an output that looks something like:

Key:   path of the .apk file
value: hash of the .apk file.
Similar to the first output.

Below attached is the way it is in the input file.

When starting the application, I have the following code, that retrieves a list of itens I need to show to the user:

Note: This code works just fine and returns something about 3k results, and is the first time the ""technologyModel"" is accessed.

Obviously, before doing that, I have to load the dataset/model, and here is the problem.

Case (1) When I load the dataset/model from a RDF file, doing this:

<pre><code>    InputStream in = FileManager.get().open(ParamsHelper.sourceRDF);
    technologyModel.read(in, ""RDF/XML-ABBREV"");
</code></pre>

the technologyModel seems instantly loaded and the first code posted runs in less than a second.

Case (2) However, when I try to load the model from a TDB database (previously loaded with the same RDF file used on first case), with this code:

<pre><code>    dataset = TDBFactory.createDataset(ParamsHelper.tdbBaseDir);
    dataset.begin(ReadWrite.READ) ;
    technologyModel = dataset.getNamedModel(""http://a.example.biz/technology"");
    dataset.end();
</code></pre>

the technologyModel doesnÂ´t seem to be instantly loaded, and even though the first code posted returns as expected, it runs in about 30 seconds at the first call.

If I call that same code after the first time, or, for example, insert another operation like technologyModel.listSubjects() before calling this code for the first time, it will run immediately, as expected.

It seems to me that on the second case, the model is really loaded only afthe the first operation it suffers. Does it make any sense?

I donÂ´t want to keep my data in a RDF file, but rather have a TDB database storing the triples. ThatÂ´s why the second option seems to fit me better.

Can anyone help me on this? I hope I could expose the problem correctly.

Now since a[i] contains the word Temperature, b[i] will be set to ""Set Temerature (C)"". (This is the business rule).

In this case a[i] will not be equal to b[i].

For my testing purpose how can trim value of b[i] to set to Set Temprature?

1167,27516950,"I would like to cause Excel to format a number as Java formats a float, or at least similarly.  In particular, I would like to have it display an arbitrary number of digits to the RIGHT of the decimal point, but always have at least a <code>.0</code> in the case of an integer.

To restate slightly differently: I want Excel to do what it normally does, except if it wants to display an int, in which case it should append <code>.0</code> to it.

Some examples:<pre>
12.0
12.5
 0.0
 0.5368</pre>

We observed the following:

Soon we installed the jdk 1.6 on ubuntu server and pointed  home to jdk1.6 and started the  processes. Some are complied on jdk 1.6 and some are compiled in jdk 1.5. We have total 9  tomcat process running on the same ubuntu server with 2GB RAM and 80GB hard disk. We started seeing high IO wait and web pages took forever to show up. The server in same state for one to two days and then IO wait is reduced. 

Is there any way to what process is causing high IO wait and why it is causing?

I have come up with my own data type which my program is able to read, but I need it somehow included in PDF file (no multiple files, I want one file per single output).
I also need this data to be invisible and undetectable for the user.

I heard something about PDF dictionaries, but I'm not sure how to do it (or if there's another way). I do not want to use XMP/XML file, my data is more complex than key-value.

What would be nice is somebody writing me couple example lines of code that would enable me to:

<ul>
<li>add new dicitonary to PDF using iText</li>
<li>populate it with data using iText</li>

But this wont work in my situation since I will be dealing with a alot of streaming data and this has to stay in memory and has to work quickly.

but in the server terminal i receive this:

I have implemented the php code for decryption.

Related to <a href=""http://chrononsystems.com/blog/-7-design-flaw-leads-to-huge-backward-step-for-the-jvm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chrononsystems.com/blog/-7-design-flaw-leads-to-huge-backward-step-for-the-jvm</a> the  7 compiler adds stack frames to the byte code which include type verification for the stack operands. 

Byte code for this example compiled with Oracle jdk includes:

<pre><code>frame_type = 255 /* full_frame */
      offset_delta = 0
      locals = [ class ""[L/lang/String;"", class /lang/StringBuffer, class /lang/StringBuilder ]
      stack = [ class /io/PrintStream, class /lang/AbstractStringBuilder ]
</code></pre>

While bytecode from IBM jdk compiler is:

<pre><code>frame_type = 255 /* full_frame */
      offset_delta = 0
      locals = [ class ""[L/lang/String;"", class /lang/StringBuffer, class /lang/StringBuilder ]
      stack = [ class /io/PrintStream, class /io/Serializable ]
</code></pre>

The stack frame from Oracle resolves to the base class AbstractStringBuilder class.  That class does not exist in IBM JRE rt.jar.  We use Oracle JDK in our build process &amp; Iâm reluctant to change that. This  7 type verification seems to create non-portable bytecode.
Is there a way to disable this type verification checking at either compile time or runtime?

1179,27618710,"I need to return a value from a PL/SQL block in MyBatis.

The PL/SQL block is this:

I know I could do it like this:

<pre><code>&lt;update id=""updateAll"" parameterType=""map""&gt;

But this means I must have a method like this in the  mapper:

I have this instead:

<pre><code>public int updateAll(@Param(""params"") List&lt;PriorityModel&gt; model);

<li>Webcam. (which contains the design SWING GUI -JFRAME FORM :the buttons and the panels etc.)

Here, I don't think you need the entire code. It's generated by Netbeans when I designed the interface. I'll put just the class:

<pre><code>import x.swing.Icon;
import x.swing.ImageIcon;
import x.swing.JOptionPane;

public class Webcam extends x.swing.JFrame {
    functiiwebcam b = new functiiwebcam();
    /** Creates new form Webcam */
    public Webcam() {
        initComponents();
        this.setTitle(""Webcam"");
        // Centreaza ferestra
        this.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        // Aplicare Layout de tip BOX panoului cu numele broadcast (cel in care se afiseaza imaginile de pe webcam)       
        broadcast.setLayout(new x.swing.BoxLayout(broadcast, x.swing.BoxLayout.LINE_AXIS));
        // Adaugarea componentei video
        broadcast.add(b.Componente());
    }

    // Button for webcam capture
    private void jButton1ActionPerformed(.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {                                         
        b.capturareImagine();

        Icon icon = new x.swing.ImageIcon(b.getImage());
        captura.setIcon(icon);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

When I run the application it throws me this exception. But it's curious that sometimes it works; I can select the device from the window that appears and I can see the image from the webcam and even capture it. What is wrong?

I have a Java application where I'm attempting to apply internationalization to my logging. Everything works fine in Eclipse, it's only when I attempt to deploy the compiled jars to the test environment that the properties file cannot be located. My properties file is called logging_en.properties. I've verified that it's on the file system (Linux, by the way). When I launch my application, I execute the following command:

My CLASSPATH variable is:

<pre><code>/data/dev/app/server/logging_en.properties:/data/dev/app/common/lib/common.jar:/data/dev/app/common/ext/dirmi-1.1.1.jar:/data/dev/app/common/ext/log4j-1.2.17.jar:/data/dev/app/common/ext/cojen-2.2.3.jar:/data/dev/app/common/lib/server.jar

The properties file is in my classpath. In the code itself, the exact line I run is:

<pre><code>LogManager.getLogger(""server"").setResourceBundle(.util.ResourceBundle.getBundle(""logging""));
</code></pre>

At the very beginning when the server starts, I invariably get the Missing Resource exception:

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" .util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name logging, locale en_US
</code></pre>

Just to be safe, I've gone so far as to co the file to logging.properties and logging_en_US.properties and added all three to my classpath. Still the same issue. I know I'm doing something stupid or missing something obvious, but I'm really at a loss. I'd prefer not to bundle the file into my jar so it can be modified on the fly, so I'm hoping it's possible to do this from the classpath.

This will highlight the characters one at a time and all the characters will remain highlighted. Now, I'd like the same behavior (all the characters remain highlighted) but I'd like to change the text in between highlights, like this:

Notice the text in the pane is changing and then I'm applying a new highlight. The old highlights go away- I'd like them to stay. My assumption is the highlights go away each time you setText(). So, is there any way to keep the highlights in the text component while changing the text?

I have the following String (the JSON payload) and I like to validate when the messageDate is null.

ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Foo f1 = mapper.readValue(payload, Foo.class);
System.out.println(""Foo is "" + f1.getMessageDate() + f1.getName());

When messageDate is null, I noticed that getNullValue() in the custom serializer class gets called. Right now I am sending an instance of XMLGregorianCalendar when it is null.

The following gets printed

<pre><code>Get null value called &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 
Foo is 2013-12-09T17:26:00.642-08:00someName
</code></pre>

Instead of returning a non null value, I would like to throw an error.

Also I observed that after getNonValue() gets called, the deserialize(...) method is not called.

Looks like when it sees null, it calls getNullValue() and whatever value returned in the method is used.

When it is not null, the actual value in the payload is used and deserialize(...) method gets invoked.

Instead of this behavior, I would like to throw an error when it is null in the payload.

How do I do it?

1228,32034490,"I get a ClassCastException when trying to query my JPA entity class.  I only want json to show two columns.  That is name and address.  How do I only show selected columns in JPA?  From debugging it has to be the for loop. So List is the object and I need to make the right side an object instead of a list correct?

<strong>Entity</strong>

<pre><code>@Entity

this.address = address;
}

@Id
@Column(name = ""name"", unique = true, nullable = false)
public String getName() {
    return this.name;
}....
 //setters getters

<strong>Query/Impl</strong>

<pre><code>public List&lt;User&gt; getRecords(User ent){

This is my attempt to declare the result object as List.  Does the method have to be an object instead of ?

Say there are no concurrency issues in terms of reusing a single RequestHandler object between threads. Would there ever be any performance benefit in creating one RequestHandler per thread? Or is it better to reuse a single RequestHandler between threads (each maintaining a reference to the same RequestHandler)?

Edit: In reponse to Jack's answer- yes, we are assuming that the handleRequest method is completely thread safe and does not contain any synchronization block or object.

But when the html form is submitted the data is saved in MYSQL and the JSP page displays the Card with the details on its desired position. What I am looking at is that is there a way to make that card image along with the details appear as an image which the user can directly download coz now if the user is trying to download he just gets the Blank background image without any data. Is there a way to merge the card image and the data as a single image or something which can easily be downloaded and also sent as an image to the users email.

any idea how to beat it? .exe is running on port 1966 and when I close the JBoss the port is free again. I have turned off the firewall(both windows and comodo).

I think the problem is

<blockquote>
  check that an instance of SQL Server
  is running on the host and accepting
  TCP/IP connections
</blockquote>

How to check it? the war and the whole JBoss is working on other computer(its a mirror co of the working JBoss)

1242,32628410,"I want to have a <code>ListView</code> having a custom <code>ListCell</code> factory (for simplicity sake) with a <code>Label</code> scaling to the size of the parent (<code>ListView</code>). My workaround solution at the moment is to pass the size of the <code>ListView</code> to the <code>ListCell</code> to set the width of each list cell's <code>Label</code>. This seems to be not optimal, as on resizing the <code>ListView</code> the <code>ListCells</code> are not resized (without further code like a resizeliste etc.).

How can I improve my layout to have growing <code>Labels</code> (to the bounds of my <code>ListView</code>) in each <code>ListCell</code>?

The launch parameters are (now)

I have been trying a few launch options without much success so far.

The stack size is large because I need to serialize/unserialize a huge Java object.

The Jetty setup is:

<pre><code>QueuedThreadPool threadPool = new QueuedThreadPool(56, 10);
server = new Server(threadPool);
ServerConnector connector = new ServerConnector(server);
connector.setIdleTimeout(1000);         
connector.setPort(port);
connector.setHost(hote);
server.addConnector(connector);

The application serves 6.67 requests per second on average (peak 16.23 request per second). The average request time is 42ms. There is no database I/O. There is a little file I/O by Lucene and logging.

I can't be 100% sure that there are no memory leeks but the various tools I have used (Java Visual VM and various Jetty LeekPreventers) seem to indicate that there are none (or that it is insignificant).

The application runs for 24 hours and is restarted.

<ol>
<li>Openshift issue</li>
<li>Application or Restlet issue</li>

My app is deployed with a Tomcat 7 cartrige with Openshift, so far it works fine the only things is that response gets truncated. 

E.g.

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;..&lt;d
</code></pre>

The missing/incomplete div tag and those kind of issues due to truncating. Is this kind of issue needs to be solved from RedHat's Openshift or fixing with Resteasy code is possible?

After searching a bit, it seems this is a common issue, response being truncated to 8k:

The preference dialog shows, but I'm not able to see any changes after closing it.

            &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
    &lt;/receiver&gt;

And here's the BroadcastReceiver. I never see the ""WTF"" in logcat. What am I doing wrong?

<pre><code>package com.starlon.froyvisuals;

import android.content.BroadcastReceiver;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.content.Context;
import android.util.Log;

public class FroyVisualsReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver
{
    @Override
    public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent)
    {
        Log.e(""WTFWTF"", ""WTFWTFWTFW"");
        String action = intent.getAction();
        if(action.equals(""com.starlon.froyvisuals.PREFS_UPDATE""))
        {
            ((FroyVisuals)context).updatePrefs();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

Oh here's onPause where I'm broadcasting the PREFS_UPDATE intent.I do see the logcat message. This method is part of my PreferenceActivity.

<pre><code>    /** another activity comes over this activity */
    @Override
    public void onPause()
    {
        Log.i(TAG, ""onPause ================================ "");

1262,39752950,"<strong>Update:</strong> I see what my problem is. I'm sorting 10000 datapoints every time. That will take the same time each iteration. <code>t</code> was my incorrect way of attempting to sort 100 of those datapoints, then add the next 100 datapoints, sort and so on.

I am trying to show that the average/best case running time for Quicksort is O(nlogn). However when I try to time the method over a large amount of cycles I get linear run time.

I assume it has something to do with the way I'm implementing the for loop, but I have no idea why it would be wrong.

I also have another function that reads an array already sorted to give me worst case run time, but that also gives me linear.

I've written a Servlet Filter that will recieve the request and then use the commons HttpClient to dispatch it to the host specified by the 'url' parameter.

Everything works for GET but I am having difficulties getting the 'url' parameter value for POST's.

According to the doc I see in eclipse it should be request.getRequestURI() but this is only returning the value of the post minus the url parameter value (i.e. <a href=""http://webhost:8080/app/proxy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webhost:8080/app/proxy/</a>)

We have to use the Matcher class, so there is no chance to hardcode the tokenizer in anyway (that would be too simple: a simple state machine + map lookup, but we are not allowed to do that).

The tokenizer must have 2 methods (""hasNext"" and ""next"").

I need some example to see how to use the Matcher to match a string with delimiters that depend on context (the Scanner class is not suitable because will ""eat"" delimiters, while delimiters are part of the grammar see following example:

<pre><code>(3 plus 5)*(8/3*7)
</code></pre>

It should be tokenized to

<pre><code>(.3.plus.5.).*.(.8./.3.*.7.)
</code></pre>

I can use ""(|)|\s+"" as delimiter but then the scanner will return just

<pre><code>3 plus 5 * 8 / 3 * 7
</code></pre>

and due to operators associativity the result will be 

<pre><code>3 plus (((5*8)/3)*7)
</code></pre>

wich is incorrect.

I need to do the following:

Given a set of patterns (Identificator, Integer, ReservedKeywords, Symbols, Blank, whatever). I need to match the first occurrence of any of these patterns. The delimiters are ""Symbols | Blank""
but the delimiters should not be discarded, instead they should be returned as tokens.
This must be done using the Matcher class.

An example showing how to tokenize a string using as delimiters ""Blank | Symbols"" returning or the delimited string or the delimiter itself should be enough.

1293,36918590,"I've been given an assignment the hand in on Wednesday and it is to create a Ludo game. I have the jist of everything working but I cannot figure out how to make the player pawns take a set path. so obviously the board is in a + looking shape and the pawns move around the board. Is there anyway I can set it so that they all follow that path.

My idea would be to have a int[][] pos of each ""tile"" and depending on which player you are, it starts at a different position in the list. So e.g:

<pre><code>pos[0][5]
pos[5][10]&lt;First tile a red pawn should start
pos[10][15]
pos[15][20]&lt;First tile  a blue pawn should start
pos[20][25]

and then loop through this list of positions until the win condition is satisfied.
This is my idea but I was hoping there maybe another way

1296,11834780,"I'm reading a lot of data from three tables in an Access database ~2 million rows, maybe 100MB of text.
I was using the following SELECT statement:

This was taking a while (approx 2 mins) so I looked for ways to make it faster.
I read about prepared statements and decided to try making one. Following various tutorials I put this together:

PreparedStatement prest = con.prepareStatement(SQL);
prest.setString(1, county_ID);

ResultSet result = prest.executeQuery();

It still works, but now it takes over 15 mins. I've had a good Google but I can't seem to spot what I'm doing wrong. Are prepared statements just not appropriate for my particular problem?

I am trying to implement Merge Sort algorithm using ArrayList where program will read data (Integer in each line) from file and produce sorting result using Merge Sort. However, my code is showing same result as it has not sorted anything out! I would be very glad if someone can identify where did I do my mistake. As i am a beginner, the code is very simple, not optimized and not very fast in performance probably.

Here is my code:

<pre><code>public class MergeSortExp1 {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;number = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();

        Scanner myScanner = null;
        try {
        myScanner = new Scanner(new File(""/Users/Sabbir/Desktop/workload.txt""));
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {

        e.printStackTrace();
        }

        while(myScanner.hasNextInt()){
            number.add(myScanner.nextInt());
        }

        System.out.println(""Before sorting"" +number);
        number=mergeSort(number);
        System.out.println(""Sorted Array ="" +number);
    }

        public static ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; mergeSort( ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; Input)
        {
            if (Input.size() ==1){
                return Input;
            }
            else {
                int mid= Input.size()/2;
                ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; left= new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(mid);
                ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; right=new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;(Input.size()-mid);

               for (int i = 0; i &lt; mid; i++) {
                   left.add(Input.get(i));
                   } 

               for (int i = 0; i &lt; Input.size()-mid; i++) {
                   right.add(Input.get(i));
               } 

               left=mergeSort(left); 
               right=mergeSort(right);
               merge(left,right,Input);
            }
               return Input;
        }


        public static void merge (ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;left,ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;right,ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;Input)
        {
            int i1=0;// left Index
            int i2=0;// right Index
            int InputIndex=0;

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; Input.size(); i++) {
                if (i2&gt;=right.size() || (i1&lt;left.size() &amp;&amp; left.get(i)&lt;=right.get(i))) 
                {
                    Input.set(InputIndex,left.get(i1));
                    InputIndex++;
                }
                else {

However, setOneShotPreviewCallback() only gets called once.  I run it in debugging mode and it stops at the breakpoint of the method call during every iteration, but stops only once in the breakpoint located in OnPreviewFrame().

It also appears setOneShotPreviewCallback() is on the same thread as the loop, if that is helpful.

more than 1 parent have children referenced in the database, this exception
will be thrown.</li>
<li>Also if I change the type of ""oid"" from ""long"" to ""int"" the exception will change, too: ""...LongId cannot be cast... -> ...IntId cannot be cast...""</li>

1309,38566530,"Hi I have tried Looking for a solution online but it doesn't seem to apply to my problem

I am trying to use a straightforward getText from a textfield in my JForm when I press the register button it works if i try to get the value from the method addCustomer() but in the addCustomer() i have a method called isValid() which checks that it can be added it is here that the txtFullName.getText() does not work with the NullPointerException.

I have tried getting the text value from the addCustomer() using String name = txtFullName.getText() and passing that as a parameter to the isValid() this does work but I don't want to have to pass every variable that i want checking.

I just want to be able to use the standard getText method to do this.

To be clear: 
I do understand what a NullPointerException is, but I don't understand why I receive one in this situation since I check before executing that the String jsonMovieModelList is at least not null. Why is gson 'losing' the reference?

1313,14752760,"I have a simple Client/Server app.  The server is set up so that if no data comes in within N seconds a timeout occurs and the socket connection is closed.  I do this via Socket.setSoTimeout().  That all works fine if the client hangs.  If the clients dies, though (e.g. I kill it with Ctrl-C), then readLine() never times out.

Here's the server code, if that makes a difference:

<pre><code>public void run()
{
    PrintWriter out = null;
    BufferedReader in = null;

    try {
        sock.setSoTimeout(10000);

I've tried putting in a signal handler into the client to send an ABEND message over to the server but that's not working (I suspect the socket gets closed before the ABEND is sent, but I haven't really spent any time trying to figure that out).

Is there a way to wake up periodically and check the socket state to see if it's closed?  Or (better yet) not have readLine() hang if the socket closes?  Should I be using an unbuffered reader of some sort?  Does an unbuffered reader supporting a readLine-like mechanism exist?

I am using Java 6 on Linux.

EDIT: I'm killing the client myself during an idle period; all data has been sent and received at this point.  I have verified (via ps) that the client program is no longer running; the Java process has indeed been killed. Using netstat I can see that the socket is closed, on both ends, yet readLine() still hangs.

Constructor:

    int eingabe2=(new Integer(zeile)).intValue();

Bewertung neueBewertung = new Bewertung(eingabe1, eingabe2);
return neueBewertung;

}

Main-Method: Here we construct two Objects, that construct 2 new objects with the readBewertung()-Method, and then we try to print them and do some other stuff. Everything
but the printing works fine.

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
try

Bewertung Bewertung1 = MeineBewertung1.readBewertung();
  System.out.println(Bewertung1.toString());

  if (Bewertung1.equals(Bewertung2)) {
  System.out.println(""Die beiden Bewertungen sind identisch!"");
  }
}
catch ( IOException e)
{

The problem: I get some squares instead of the Objects cast in a String how intended. I don't know what is wrong, but the mistake has to be anywhere in the to.String()-method.

1326,17000110,"I am making this program that needs to render colored quads.
I am using VBOs for this.

<em>This is how I store the data for the vertices and the colors:</em>

<strong>render quad:</strong>

<pre><code> buff.put(3 floats color)
 render the quad (3 floats per vertex * 4 per face * 6 per quad) 
</code></pre>

Now as you see my aim is to use interleaved VBOs but I cant figure out the stride and offset.

<strong>Here are my calls when rendering:</strong>

(Note im using mapped vbos thats why there is no actual data binding):

<pre><code>        glBindBufferARB(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, etn.getVboHandel());
        glBufferDataARB(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER_ARB, etn.getVboData().capacity() &lt;&lt; 2, GL_STATIC_DRAW_ARB);

        glColorPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, /* stride **/6 &lt;&lt; 2, /* offset **/0); 
        glVertexPointer(3, GL_FLOAT, /* stride **/6 &lt;&lt; 2, /* offset **/0);

        glDrawArrays(GL_QUADS, 0,  etn.getVboData().capacity());

I cant get the offset and stride to be correct so when I render I see this weird artifacts..

1332,6159640,"My spring web application is using ajax with spring, and it based in general on the demo application provided by spring:

On the client-side I have a form (JSP):

<pre><code>&lt;form:form modelAttribute=""createLevel"" action=""createLevel"" method=""post""&gt;  
    &lt;div class=""form-item""&gt;  

    &lt;form:label id=""nameLabel"" for=""name"" path=""name"" cssErrorClass=""error""&gt;Level Name&lt;/form:label&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

    &lt;input type=""submit"" value=""Submit""&gt;  
    &lt;/div&gt;  
&lt;/form:form&gt;
</code></pre>

I submit the form to the server by the following js method:

<pre><code>$(""#createLevel"").submit(function() {
        var level = $(this).serializeObject();
        $.postJSON(""create.do"", level, function(data) {
            alert(data);
        });
        return false;               
    });
</code></pre>

On the server-side I have a validation as it shown below:

<pre><code>public final class LevelDto extends AbstractDto implements Serializable {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    private int id;

    @NotNull
    @Size(min = 2, max = 30)
    @LevelExistsConstraint(message = ""Level with provided name is exists"")
    private String name;
    // set; get;
}
</code></pre>

And Controller

<pre><code>   @RequestMapping(value = ""/admin/create.do"", method = RequestMethod.POST)
    public @ResponseBody
Map&lt;String, ? extends Object&gt; createLevel(@RequestBody LevelDto level,
        HttpServletResponse response) {
    //JSR-303 
    Set&lt;ConstraintViolation&lt;LevelDto&gt;&gt; failures = validator.validate(level);

    if (!failures.isEmpty()) {
        response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_BAD_REQUEST);
        return validationMessages(failures);

    } else {

        return Collections.singletonMap(""id"", 10);

    }
}
</code></pre>

When I submit incorrect data to the server I see that all things are going on correctly - my validator is processing data, and the client is receiving an error response; moreover, in the response content I see the following:

<pre><code>{""name"":""size must be between 2 and 30""}
</code></pre>

My problem is that I do not know how to bind received error message correctly. Obviously, I can do it by js, but I thought that Spring is binding all error messages automatically to the view. 

Any help is really appreciated.

1333,30816700,"So I been trying to implement LinkedList, Stack, Queue in Java.

For each one i'm using a node class such that, now I don't really want to discuss how my implementation is since I am aware there are better ways to do it, I just want to focus on my question.

<pre><code>public class Node&lt;E&gt; {
    private E data;
    private Node&lt;E&gt; next;
    private Node&lt;E&gt; prev;

    public Node(E data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
        this.prev = null;
    }

    public E getData() {
        return this.data;
    }

    public Node&lt;E&gt; getNext() {
        return this.next;
    }

    public Node&lt;E&gt; getPrev() {
        return this.prev;
    }

    public void setPrev(Node&lt;E&gt; prev) {
        this.prev = prev;
    }

    public void setData(E data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public void setNext(Node&lt;E&gt; next) {
        this.next = next;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Now with the node class there, I keep getting mixed up on how the garbage collector works, so lets say this is my queue class

<pre><code>public class Queue&lt;E&gt; {
    private int size;
    private Node&lt;E&gt; head, tail;

    public Queue() {
        this.size = 0;
        this.head = this.tail = null;
    }

    public Queue(E data) {
        Node&lt;E&gt; temp = new Node&lt;E&gt;(data);
        this.tail = this.head = temp;
        this.size = 0;
    }

    public boolean enqueue(E data) {
        Node&lt;E&gt; temp = new Node&lt;E&gt;(data);

        if (this.head == null) {
            this.tail = temp;
            this.head = temp;
        } else {
            temp.setNext(this.head);
            this.head.setPrev(temp);
            this.head = temp;
        }
        this.size++;
        return true;
    }

    public E dequeue() {
        if (this.tail == null)
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
        else {
            E data = this.tail.getData();
            this.tail.setPrev(null);
            this.tail = temp;
            this.tail.setNext(null);
            this.size--;
            return data;
        }
    }

    public int getSize() {
        return this.size;
    }

    public E peak() {
        if (this.tail == null)
            throw new IndexOutOfBoundsException();
        else
            return this.tail.getData();
    }

    public boolean contains(E data) {
        if (this.head == null)
            return false;
        else {
            for (Node&lt;E&gt; cursor = this.head; cursor != null; cursor = cursor
                    .getNext()) {
                if (cursor.getData().equals(data))
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Now I am getting how the garbage collector works confused. I have heard, it will clean up any references that don't get pointed too. So I keep getting nullpointerexception on my dequeue class on the part that does the 

<pre><code> this.tail.setNext(null);
</code></pre>

now, hearing that for garbage collector to work, nothing can reference it, so I thought to myself my nodes are set up like this

<pre><code>       head          tail
 null&lt;-[1]-&gt;&lt;-[2]-&gt;&lt;-[3]-&gt;null
</code></pre>

where each node can point to next and to previous, so for my dequeue I think I have to do few things

1) get the data (that is easy)

2) get a temp Node that points to previous 

<pre><code> Node&lt;E&gt; temp = this.tail.getPrev()
</code></pre>

3) now here is where I start to get lost, in order for each node to no longer be referenced, I have to get rid of all things pointer to it, so this means that I must set to null the 

<pre><code>this.tail.setPrev(null);
</code></pre>

since when I delete the node after that, I can't go backwards to erase that reference

<pre><code>       head               tail
 null&lt;-[1]-&gt;&lt;-[2]-&gt; null&lt;-[3]-&gt;null
 &lt;-[temp]-&gt; ( equals node [2])
</code></pre>

4) Is set tail to point at temp node, which is what the prev node was

<pre><code>this.tail = temp;
</code></pre>

no it should look like this

<pre><code>       head   tail    
 null&lt;-[1]-&gt;&lt;-[2]-&gt;(this still points to [3])    null&lt;-[3]-&gt;null
</code></pre>

5) but the second node still points to the memory address of [3], so i continue to 

<pre><code>this.tail.setNext(null); 
</code></pre>

in order to make it so nothing at all references any spot of memory no longer in us,

<pre><code>       head   tail         will be deleted by GC
 null&lt;-[1]-&gt;&lt;-[2]-&gt;null      null&lt;-[3]-&gt;null
</code></pre>

However, THIS PART gives me <code>NullPointerException</code> when there is only one node left in queue.

Now, I know I may be wrong on a lot of this, I am still learning, but I am jsut not sure how much stuff I have to do to each node to make sure garbage collector gets it so any help will do, do i need to set both prev and next to null? or only one? etc, so any help will be appreciated, thank you ;)

So that I write a string through my serial port when the <code>Button</code> is clicked and a different string is send when I release the <code>Button</code>.  

I have two problems
1. when I first open the application, I have to press the <code>Button</code> twice before anything happens
2. for every additional click the action happens again. EG first click ""HELLO"" Second click ""HELLO HELLO""

I suspect my problem is that my first click registers the <code>EventFilter</code> and then each subsequent event creates a new <code>EventFilter</code>

How do I prevent this from happening?

1338,4079500,"I have the following modeling problem:

as an exercise I need to model a system that allocates units (police cars/fire trucks) to a specific emergency (fire/robbery/...). Therefore an emergency needs to say how much units it needs (for instance 2 fire trucks and 3 ambulances). Of course these units need to be assigned to that emergency. I've modeled this as two abstract classes: Emergency and Unit with the real units and emergencies that inherit these classes.

Is there an elegant design so the emergency can tell in a generic way which units it needs (additional types of units and emergencies are expected)?

The programming language is Java.

Now I need to unwind both array Topics and Entities and then I want to group by on date and sum all values for sentiment so I did it as follow:

    DBObject groupBy = new BasicDBObject(""$group"", groupFields );
    AggregationOutput output = collectionG.aggregate(where,unwind, groupBy);
</code></pre>

Now the problem is that for sum of vaues of sentiment just 0 returned but If I remove the following line :

<pre><code>    unwind.put(""$unwind"", ""$Topics"");
</code></pre>

it works correctly so my problem is how to unwind two arrays with one aggregation?

Update : 

I changed my code as follow :

<pre><code>DBObject unwind = new BasicDBObject(""$unwind"", ""$Entities""); // ""$unwind"" converts object with array into many duplicate objects, each with one from array
    DBObject unwindT = new BasicDBObject(""$unwind"", ""$Topics""); // ""$unwind"" converts object with array into many duplicate objects, each with one from array
    collectionG = db.getCollection(""GraphDataCollection"");
    DBObject groupFields = new BasicDBObject( ""_id"", ""$Date"");
   groupFields.put(""value"", new BasicDBObject( ""$sum"", ""$Entities.Sentiment.Value""));
    groupFields.put(""value1"", new BasicDBObject( ""$sum"", ""$Topics.Sentiment.Value""));
    DBObject groupBy = new BasicDBObject(""$group"", groupFields );
    List&lt;DBObject&gt; pipeline = Arrays.asList(unwind, unwindT);
    DBObject sort = new BasicDBObject(""$sort"", new BasicDBObject(""_id"", 1));
    AggregationOutput output = collectionG.aggregate(where,unwind,unwindT, groupBy,sort);
</code></pre>

but the problem is as soon as I add the following line :

<pre><code>groupFields.put(""value1"", new BasicDBObject( ""$sum"", ""$Topics.Sentiment.Value""));

the numbers for value1 and value that are returned is not correct and I think I am not doing unwinding correctly. can anyone help ?

1352,33905400,"for my project, I need an ArrayList, that saves a value (if the if-statement turns true) of the counting index in a do-while-loop . After the loop, the list should print out the wanted and various values. However, all values are equal to the last value of the counting index.

During searching for a solution (without success), I fount out, that the ArrayList should only be used to store objects. That could somehow explain, that the ArrayList has saved the object, not the wanted values. Nevertheless, I need a dynamic list for my loop with nested loops, which is processed more than 500 times, and multiple if-statements, therefore the ArrayList.

How to fix this problem? Any alternatives?

or

Question: If you want to change the persistence unit (or point to different jdbc source), I could easily adapt the sourcecode version to read a variable from some settings file or whatever. But I cant put variables into annotations. Whats is the solution ?

Yes, I could keep always the same PU and just point the jbdc resource in the applicationserver to somewhere else, but I dont want anyone to tinker around in the admin settings of the AS.

I wrote a code and managed to display an image when i click on a rectangle (with the loadImage-fuction). The rectangle serves as a button that I want to replace with an image later.
But i actually don't just want an image to be displayed when the button is clicked. I want to call a code, to co an image onto another:

public static int SQUARE_HEIGHT = 30;
PImage img1,img2, img3;

if(mousePressed) 
      co(img2, 
              constrain(mouseX-SQUARE_WIDTH/2,0,width), 
              constrain(mouseY-SQUARE_HEIGHT/2,0,height),

              constrain(mouseY-SQUARE_HEIGHT/2,0,height), 
              SQUARE_WIDTH,SQUARE_HEIGHT);
}
</code></pre>

The co-code doesn't simply co an image, it uses the mouse as a brush! When you ""draw"" on an area, the image shows with the ""strokes"" of the brush pixel after pixel!

color rectColor;

  currentColor = baseColor;



  img1 = loadImage(""frida.jpg"");
  img2 = loadImage(""hase.jpg"");
  img3 = loadImage(""white.png"");
    background(img3);

}
  void draw() {
  update(mouseX, mouseY);

  if (rectOver) {
    fill(rectHighlight);
  } else {
    fill(rectColor);
  }
  stroke(255);

  if (mouseX &gt;= x &amp;&amp; mouseX &lt;= x+width &amp;&amp; 
      mouseY &gt;= y &amp;&amp; mouseY &lt;= y+height) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }

}
</code></pre>

Theoretically I got the tip to set a boolean in mousePressed() to do the co-operation in draw(), and then to check this boolean in draw(): if set (true) it shall do the co. But I'm unfortunately not the brightest star in the programming-sky , so could anybody show me what this part is supposed to look like? Of course, I'm open to other suggestions how to solve this problem!

1363,8849350,"We're currentyly developping an application using JMS and activemq (5.5.1).
We would like to define a higher priority for some messages, which would make them consumed first.
After setting the producer and the consumer (through spring (3.1) JMSTemplate), the priority does not fully work.
Indeed, when we ""turn off"" the consumer, and send some messages, the priority is respected, but when we add messages while the consumer is on, the messages are received in the same order they were sent.

The configuration is quite simple:

Priority was activated in the activemq config file:

<pre><code>&lt;policyEntries&gt;
  &lt;policyEntry queue=""&gt;"" prioritizedMessages=""true""/&gt;
  ...
&lt;/policyEntries&gt;
</code></pre>

And QoS was enabled in the producer template configuration:

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""jmsOCRTemplate"" class=""org.springframework.jms.core.JmsTemplate""&gt;
  &lt;property name=""connectionFactory"" ref=""connectionFactory"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""defaultDestination"" ref=""destination_ocr"" /&gt;
  &lt;property name=""explicitQosEnabled"" value=""true"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

To send a message with a high priority, we just change the template priority property on the producer side:

<pre><code>template.setPriority(9);
</code></pre>

Any idea? Is this the normal behaviour, or is there some configuration we would have forgotten?

1367,21838130,"I'm in the process of creating a Java web services client from a wsdl. I used Eclipses's Dynamic Web Project and new Web Services Client to generate the code with wsdl2 with Apache Axis 1.4. I need to add SOAP authentication to this code in order for it to work with the service. I couldn't find a place to do that in the generated code. After copious research I found this, which I've used as the backbone for my code so far. 

<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14266237/adding-ws-security-to-wsdl2-generated-classes/14332481#14332481"">Adding ws-security to wsdl2 generated classes</a>

Before I was getting a ""Error occurred while processing security for the message"" or something along those lines. Now I am getting

""Exception: Did not understand ""MustUnderstand"" header(s):{<a href=""http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd</a>}Security Message: null""

I've tried many things to get past this exception. This is the code I've arrived at now.

<pre><code>x.xml.namespace.QName headerName = new x.xml.namespace.QName(
                ""http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-wssecurity-secext-1.0.xsd"", ""Security"");
        org.apache.axis.message.SOAPHeaderElement header = new org.apache.axis.message.SOAPHeaderElement(headerName);
        header.setActor(null);
        header.setMustUnderstand(true);

        // Add the UsernameToken element to the WS-Security header
        x.xml.soap.SOAPElement utElem = header.addChildElement(""UsernameToken"");
        utElem.setAttribute(""Id"", ""uuid-3453f017-d595-4a5b-bc16-da53e5831cd1-1"");
        x.xml.soap.SOAPElement userNameElem = utElem.addChildElement(""Username"");
        userNameElem.setValue(""username"");
        x.xml.soap.SOAPElement passwordElem = utElem.addChildElement(""Password"");
        passwordElem.setAttribute(""Type"", ""http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-username-token-profile-1.0#PasswordText"");
        passwordElem.setValue(""password"");

        header.setProcessed(true);

        // Finally, attach the header to the binding.
        setHeader(header)
</code></pre>

This code is located in my Binding_ServiceStub class (in its' createCall method).

We have created clients in both C# and VB with this wsdl, and there it's as easy as just changing the ClientCredentials variable which is an extension of the proxy class generated. I was hoping for something similar here.

Here's the security policy from the wsdl code as well.

<pre><code>&lt;wsp:Policy&gt;&lt;sp:UsernameToken sp:IncludeToken=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/07/securitypolicy/IncludeToken/AlwaysToRecipient""&gt;&lt;wsp:Policy&gt;&lt;sp:WssUsernameToken10/&gt;&lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;&lt;/sp:UsernameToken&gt;&lt;/wsp:Policy&gt;
</code></pre>

Does anyone know what else I can do here? Why this exception is happening? I've tried many different combinations of prefixes and setProcesses and setMustUnderstand values all in vain (and based on my research of this exception).

And if anyone knows a way in which to add Soap header authentication to wsdl2 code I would take that too. Just need this to work and you would think something like this would be a little more straightforward or at least have more examples out there.

<strong>Update-</strong>
Confirmed that the same header passed using SOAPUI works fine. Must be something with the framework? I created a custom handler to process the SOAP Message but that didn't help. Is Axis 1.4 and JAX-RPC the problem? (I know they're outdated but still...)

This works fine until I start adding a huge number of clients (~5000), where the program crashes and I get a "".lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread"" exception.

1370,6733950,"I'm currently programming a little text editor (project for school) and I'm having some troubles finding a good and clean way to manage the undoable commands.

(It is not a code review question as it's not only about improvement. I need to change my code if I want my application to work as I want it to)

Here's how my application works: I have a concrete subject that holds the buffer that is actually an arraylist of characters. Whenever this arraylist is modified (insertion, cut, paste...), the subject updates the observers - which consist in only one gui for the moment - (MVC pattern). 

What I was doing until now for the undo and redo was saving the whole state of the buffer (through a memento), which is working fine but: 

<ul>
<li>could obviously be improved.</li>
<li>is not working for the new feature that I need to implement (recording user actions so he can play them back whenever he wants to)</li>
</ul>

I can't figure out how to save the commands instead of the buffer, and if it is the good way to go.

Here's some chunks of the program (for the insert command):

<strong>""GUI"".</strong>

<pre><code>...

class KeyboardListener extends KeyAdapter { 

    @Override
    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
            ...
            commandManager.executeCommandInsert(caretStart, caretStop, e.getKeyChar());
            ...
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<strong>CommandManager.</strong>

<pre><code>...

public void executeCommandInsert(int start, int end, char character) {  
    addMementoUndo();   
    commandInsert.setCarets(start, end);
    commandInsert.setChar(character);
    commandInsert.execute();    
}

public void addMementoUndo() 
{
    TextConcrete text = TextConcrete.getInstance();
    this.commandsUndo.add(0, text.createMemento());
    if(recordMode){
        this.recordings.add(text.createMemento());
    }
}
...
</code></pre>

<strong>CommandInsert.</strong>

<pre><code>...
public void execute(){
   TextConcrete text = TextConcrete.getInstance();
   text.insert(this.start, this.end, this.character);
}
...
</code></pre>

<strong>TextConcrete.</strong>

<pre><code>...
public void insert(int start, int end, char character){
    //inserting in ArrayList
}

public CommandUndoable createMemento(){
   CommandUndoable mem = new CommandUndoable();
   mem.setState(getState());
   return mem;
}

public String getState(){
   StringBuilder temp = new StringBuilder();
   for(int idx = 0; idx &lt; this.state.size(); idx++){
       temp.append(this.state.get(idx));
   }    
   return temp.toString();
}
...
</code></pre>

The CommandUndoable is just the memento that save the state of the buffer and then is saved in a list of memento in the CareTaker (CommandManager).

Any help would really be appreciated.

1375,22795330,"I have 4 class - Producer, Consumer, Shop, Main.

Trying to calculate average waiting time which customers are in the queue for waiting to enter the store.

My run method in Producer -

     shop.put(i);
     System.out.println(""Customer number ""  + i + "" has entered the store\n"");

     try {
        Thread.sleep((int) (Math.random() * 1000));

     } catch (InterruptedException e) { }
  }
}
</code></pre>

Part of my put method in Shop -

<pre><code>System.out.println(""The store is full! Customer "" + value + "" is waiting in the queue.....\n"");
        queueStart = System.currentTimeMillis();
        System.out.println(""Customer joined queue at time : "" + queueStart);

Would it be possible to call skill#get() when being ONLY supplied with Skill.class?

Regular Java won't allow to class#newInstance() abstract classes. Question is: Is there a way?

1385,30853650,"I am already running a web application, which access control is configured with client certificate authentication (CLIENT-CERT). Users can login with their certificates and access is granted. Fine.

If no valid client certificate is presented to tomcat, the connection is closed with this browser error: <em>ssl_error_bad_cert_alert</em>. By reloading the page no second try is possible.

I think it is difficult to explain normal users, that they have to restart their browser in case of an authentication error. Maybe there is no other way as restarting the browser.

But can I display an custom error page in case of an certificate authentication error or can the request redirected to a none restricted page?

1393,3952910,"I am trying to devise a strategy for Web Services versioning and how to handle versions from a SCM point of view.

We are doing bottom-up (JAX-WS) services, and therefore have less control over the schema and can't follow some schema versioning of the best practices. My current thoughts are:

1) Major changes (non-backwards compatible):

<ul>
<li>Transmitted to the API client via new service URL (URL versioning). E.g.:    </li>
</ul>

<a href=""http://com.example/v1/MyService"" rel=""nofollow"">http://com.example/v1/MyService</a>

<a href=""http://com.example/v2/MyService"" rel=""nofollow"">http://com.example/v2/MyService</a>

This causes in my opinion less hassle for both the client and developers. The client just updates the services URL (generally in one place) rather than updating all the service calls (like when using service name versioning - MyServiceV1, MyServiceV2,...).

<ul>
<li>In the server side, this is reflected by tagging the service in SVN: MyService-[major].[minor] E.g. MyService-1.0</li>
</ul>

2) Minor changes (backwards-compatible):

<ul>
<li>This is where I have more doubts. Some best practices, involve modifying the schema namespace which in turn involves upgrading for compatible customers.</li>
<li>In the server-side is clear as I am using the strategy above ([service_name]-[major].[minor])</li>
</ul>

Would appreciate opinions on the strategy above and suggestions for the minor versioning.

My problem is that if I use this pattern in Java it doesn't work for the case where other symbols different than whitespaces are used, like brackets.

I tested the regex in this site (<a href=""http://gskinner.com/RegExr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gskinner.com/RegExr/</a>, which is a very nice site btw) and it works, so I'm wondering if Java requires a different syntax.

1407,26963230,"I'm trying to create a method that will take a number (combinaison), and subtract a (coup) from it, char by char. If it's less than 0, the char in questions is 0.

For example, if I have a combination of 333, and I add a ""coup"" of 142, the result is 201.
Basically, it subtracts every character, one by one, and returns 0 for every negative one.
The 2 inputs must be equal in length or it returns an empty string.

I tried this, but if I enter 1 char, it gives me 48, 2 char 4848, and so on.

Solved, I just changed '0' to 0.

The following code uses simple conditional operators.

<pre><code>public class Main

    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        Integer exp1 = true ? null : 5;
        Integer exp2 = true ? null : true ? null : 50;

        Integer exp3 = false ?  5 : true ? null: 50; //Causes the NullPointerException to be thrown.

        System.out.println(""exp3 = ""+exp3);
    }
}
</code></pre>

This code compiles fine. All the expressions ultimately attempt to assign <code>null</code> to <code>Integer</code> type variables <code>exp1</code>, <code>exp2</code> and <code>exp3</code> respectively.

The first two cases <strong>don't</strong> throw any exception and produce <code>exp1 = null exp2 = null</code> which is obvious. 

The last case however, if you go through it carefully, you will see it also attempts to assign <code>null</code> to <code>Integer</code> type variable <code>exp3</code> and looks something similar to the preceding two cases but it causes the <code>NulllPointerException</code> to be thrown. Why does it happen?

1425,26019770,"I have built a mouse emulator for a severely disabled person, which has a series of buttons arranged in a + pattern, with the center button being a 'click'. The inputs are read into an Arduino Micro, which then connects through USB to the computer. A processing script, using the Arduino library, responds to these changes by moving the mouse, using the Robot class. I exported an application, for both 32-bit and 64-bit windows, but found that the .exe files were problematic, and instead opted for .bat files using the embedded Java.

This all works perfectly on my computer (Microsoft Surface, Windows 8, 64-bit). But on the client's computer (Windows 7, 32-bit), the results are erratic. Each time I load the program, I get a different result. For example, sometimes up, down, and click work. Sometimes only up and click work. And so forth. The click usually seems to work, but the directions are less reliable, with vertical working more often than horizontal.

I have verified that nothing is wrong with the board. I tried putting in a debug statement which ran println() each time a movement's ""if"" statement was tripped - I only got printing from directions that worked on that particular run.

I see a number of potential sources for this problem: the differences between 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, possible issues with the Robot class, USB performance issues (though I've tried multiple ports on the client's laptop), etc. The client's laptop has generally poor performance (for example, if I click ""Control Panel"", it may be a full minute before Control Panel opens), so that may also be related.

Does anyone have other insights on this?

1432,34666700,"I am having issues inflating a Mapbox MapView on an Android Fragment. When I use the same code on an Activity (other than standard differences between an Activity and a Fragment), I can get the MapView to load correctly, but not on the Fragment.

Mapbox also has a MapFragment class <a href=""https://github.com/mapbox/MapboxFragment"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, but I am unsure how to use this properly in a Fragment (the example is still in an Activity); with the Google Maps API I am able to use a MapView on a Fragment without a problem.

The below logcat line of:

<pre><code>at com.example.exampleapp.FragmentMap.onCreateView(FragmentMap.:133)
</code></pre>

is referring to the Java line:

<pre><code>fragmentLayout = inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_map, container, false);

What happens is if I enter an incorrect input, the scanner ""stores"" the first input and only uses it; if the input is correct, it continues. Research so far has told me to scrap the regex and just use input.hasNextLine(). Any help would be appreciated.

1436,35461700,"I'm having trouble with restoring state of a View inside a ViewPager. The View I'm putting into ViewPager is a CustomView extending FrameLayout.

Here's the code of my Activity.

<pre><code>private ViewPager vPager;
private MainPagerAdapter mAdapter;

@Override
protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    setContentView(R.layout.activity_layout);
    // all the findViewById stuff

    CustomView cv1 = new CustomView(this);
    CustomView cv2 = new CustomView(this);

    cv1.setId(R.id.custom_view_id_1);

    mAdapter = MainPagerAdapter();
    mAdapter.addView(cv1);
    mAdapter.addView(cv2);
    vPager.setAdapter(mAdapter);
}
</code></pre>

MainPagerAdapter is a class from the accepted answer of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13664155/dynamically-add-and-remove-view-to-viewpager"">this question</a>

CustomView.

<pre><code>@Override
protected Parcelable onSaveInstanceState() {
    Log.d(TAG, ""onSaveInstanceState() called"");
}

@Override
protected void onRestoreInstanceState(Parcelable state) {
    Log.d(TAG, ""onRestoreInstanceState() called"");
}
</code></pre>

Here's my findings so far:

<ol>
<li>onSaveInstanceState() will be called but onRestoreInstanceState() is not</li>
<li>When I tried to add the View directly to the root of the Activity, it calls both functions.</li>
<li>I found out that Activity's onRestoreState function will be called before the ViewPager calls the adapter's <code>instantiateItem()</code> function. So when the activity restore it's state, the ViewPager doesn't have any children yet, thus the savedState doesn't have any owner.</li>
</ol>

So I figure out that I need to make one of two things to work:

<ol>
<li>Make sure the ViewPager instantiate the item before trying to restore the state, or</li>
<li>Calls the CustomView's <code>onRestoreInstanceState()</code> manually.</li>
</ol>

I somehow managed to make option number 2, but is there any way to do option number 1?

1439,37344520,"I wrote a complex  program, that has a GUI.

In the GUI I have three buttons, ""play"", ""play all"" and ""reset"", and some table.

When I click play, the program does its logic and then prints the output to the table i mentioned. this is working fine, as intended. after a certain amount of ""play"" operations, we printed all the data to the table and so we are done and can no longer click it. at the point, i disable the play button.

When I click play all, I want it to be as if I clicked ""play"" until it is no longer possible. So I wrote this code:

As I mentioned, when I click the play button, it immediately prints the result as intended.
But when I click play all, it runs for a very long time without displaying any output, and then at the end prints just the final result. This isn't what I want. What I want is for it to print the current result, wait a bit so I can look at it, and then print the next result.

Even when I remove the Thread.sleep it is very slow (and still only prints the last result).

Is there a way to make it run faster? And more importantly - how do I make it wait before clicking the button again? I want to view the current result for a while before it clicks again.

Currently, the GUI tests are running with the default  look and feel. Because of this, some tests are failing, but should I consider this to be a bug in the GUI, or test using my custom look and feel?

Later edit:

Thank you Andrew Tompson for the quick answer. But the issue I think still remains, because of the way the flow layout works. 
Here's a mockup of what happens:

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gf6xp.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">

The standard LAF uses a bigger font than the one I am using, and this causes one of the buttons to get out of the layout. And I can't use pack(), since there's a size requirement for that container. If you didn't call frame.pack() in that example, I think you would have the same issue.

Using the <code>jmap</code> command you are supposed to be able to turn core dump files into files in the hprof file format, which you can then analyse using VisualVM and a number of other tools. I've tried this and get an error message. This was the command that I ran (on the same box that the crash took place, using the same JVM):

That's not a very helpful error message. I wondered if it was a permissions issue, but I get the same message running the command as the same use that ran the JVM that caused the core dump. I also wondered if the core file was corrupt, so I decided to use <code>gdb</code> to see if I could open up the core file and see what was in it. This is what I get:

And at that point I quit, because I know absolutely nothing about <code>gbd</code> and how to use it to diagnose this sort of issue. I don't even really understand what that last command did. One thing worth noting is that there are exactly 134 of those ""New Thread"" lines present in the output, and, if each one represents a new thread spawning in the JVM, this could be the reason the JVM died.

So my question is in fact, three fold - 

1) Any idea why the <code>jmap</code> command may have given that error message? 

2) any ideas what the <code>gdb</code> output means? 

3) any idea how to use <code>gdb</code> to further diagnose this issue?

1448,34346690,"I'm trying very hard to understand GWT's layout system that they introduced in 2.0. It's supposedly recommended, but it seems much more complex that the old way.

What I want to do, (which I feel is a very basic design) is build an application with a header, left vertical menu, footer, and a scrolling content section.

So, to do that, you do this:

<pre><code>DockLayoutPanel panel = new DockLayoutPanel();

FlowPanel header = new FlowPanel();
FlowPanel menu = new FlowPanel();
FlowPanel footer = new FlowPanel();

ScrollPanel content = new ScrollPanel();

panel.addNorth(header);
panel.addWest(menu);
panel.addSouth(footer);

panel.add(content);

RootLayoutPanel.get().add(panel);
</code></pre>

That works perfectly fine. Except, the ScrollPanel (where all content goes) apparently breaks the layout flow. So, in my activity, I have:

<pre><code>@Override
public void start(AcceptsOneWidget panel, EventBus eventBus)
{
    FlowPanel viewPanel = new FlowPanel();

    panel.add(viewPanel);
}
</code></pre>

If I add a TabLayoutPanel to the viewPanel, it will not display correctly. I have to add it to a LayoutPanel that is attached to a LayoutPanel that is attached to a LayoutPanel, etc. all the way up to the RootLayoutPanel.

So, I try this:

<pre><code>@Override
public void start(AcceptsOneWidget panel, EventBus eventBus)
{
    LayouPanel viewPanel = new LayoutPanel();

    panel.add(viewPanel);
}
</code></pre>

And in my ui:binder, I have:

<pre><code>&lt;g:LayoutPanel&gt;
    &lt;g:layer&gt;
        &lt;g:TabLayoutPanel barHeight=""3.33"" barUnit=""EM"" height=""500px""&gt;
            &lt;!-- tabs go here --&gt;
        &lt;/g:TabLayoutPanel&gt;
    &lt;/g:layer&gt;
&lt;/g:LayoutPanel&gt;
</code></pre>

So 2 things here.

<ol>
<li>I don't want to set the height. I want the tab panel to be as big as the content. I don't get why you have to set heights in this ""better"" method of laying out your app.</li>
<li>It still doesn't show on the screen at all. I'm assuming because it's being attached to the ScrollPanel. What confuses me is that ScrollPanel does indeed implement RequiresSize and ProvidesResize, so is it not a valid LayoutPanel? That's literally all LayoutPanel does. It's a ComplexPanel that implements those interfaces</li>
</ol>

When I inspect the page, and hover over where the TabLayoutPanel should be, I get a blue highlight (in Chrome) as if it were there, but it seems the 

<pre><code>&lt;g:layer&gt; 
</code></pre>

that wraps it has no height, so it hides the TabLayoutPanel. In fact, if I edit it in the viewer to have a height, the TabLayoutPanel does show.

Am I doing something fundamentally wrong here? I would very much like to do:

RootLayoutPanel > DockLayoutPanel > ScrollPanel > *Some Container > TabLayoutPanel

And for things to just... work. I'm trying to convert my current app to this new layout stuff to get rid of all the tables that get generated under the hood, but it seems to cause more problems than it fixes.

*This container has things above and below the Tab Panel

I would like to ensure that, when the outbound adapter is failing, the aggregator stops releasing messages, and, in turn,  the backpressure propagates up the integration flow, until finally the outbound adapter comes back online. 

This seems to me to be a desirable pattern within EIP, and, while I'm pretty sure it involves queue backed channels, I'm unsure how this is implemented for a couple of reasons.

A) If the failure start of the adapter is connoted by exceptions (and in fact I'm using <code>@retryable</code> on the outbound adapter), what is the 'right' way to requeue messages?

B) I'm <em>assuming</em> the aggregator's reaper thread will respect downstream queue 'backpressure.' That said, how does one tell the aggregator to stop consuming messages from upstream in that situation?

1458,11756920,"i'm stuck on this process from two days, before posting i've searched a lot of topic and looks like it's a so simple issue. But i didn't get the problem.

Scenario is basic: i want to parse an XML from a remote computer through http connection:

<pre><code>  import .io.*;
  import .net.HttpURLConnection;
  import .net.URL;
  try {
       URL url = new URL(""http://host:port/file.xml"");
       HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
       connection.setRequestMethod(""GET"");
       connection.setRequestProperty(""Accept"",""application/xml"");
       InputStream is = connection.getInputStream();
       BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is));
       PrintWriter pw = new PrintWriter(""localfile_pw.xml"");
       FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(""localfile_os.xml"");
</code></pre>

Then i tried three different ways to read the XML

Reading byte stream

<pre><code>   byte[] buffer = new byte[4 * 1024];
   int byteRead;
   while((byteRead= is.read(buffer)) != -1){
                fos.write(buffer, 0, byteRead);
    }
</code></pre>

Reading charachter per character

<pre><code>   char c;
   while((c = (char)br.read()) != -1){
          pw.print(c);
          System.out.print(c);
    }
</code></pre>

Reading line per line

<pre><code>    String line = null; 
    while((line = br.readLine()) != null){
                pw.println(line);
                System.out.println(line);
    }
</code></pre>

In all cases my xml reading stops at the same point, after the same <strong>exact nuumber of bytes</strong>. And gets stuck without reading and without giving any exception.

Firstly I am using the Netbeans IDE. I have very little knowledge of how chmod works because i am not a linux user.
How should this chmod. work? Basically you don't need to explain everything as I will learn it by myself if the code already works.

Here is the arguments i have tried on netbeans

<pre><code>-R u+w,o-rwx C:\Users\Josh\Desktop\chin.txt
</code></pre>

But it gives an error

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" .lang.UnsupportedOperationException

I have managed to get a ""Spring BlazeDS"" application working (with Flex), but now I'm at the point where I need to implement security, and if the samples would compile and run correctly, it'd be a huge help.  I am new to Maven, but any help would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance StackOverflow community!

On running the above code, I get ClassNotFoundException for TestObjectImpl_stub . I looked around the web and found two possible workarounds:

<ol>
<li>Specify the path of the class files in CLASSPATH variable.</li>
<li>While executing the test, mention .rmi.server.codebase=location along with the  command, location being the location of the class files.</li>

Which of the above method is more appropriate? Is there a better solution for this?

As you can see, the zero index is empty for some reason, and right before my object starts there is an opening and closing bracket ([]), which makes my android app recognize that as an array instead of object.

here's my php code:

 }else{

 $array[] = array();

<strong>EDIT #1</strong> As @Hendra Wijaya Djiono Suggest I edit my code And Its Returns Null Still and I think its more cause of fragment launch when there is no value (I am calling AsyncTask before too) where i start Parent Activity Like This

<strong>EDIT #2</strong> As both <strong>@Hendra Wijaya Djiono</strong> and <strong>@cricket_007</strong> suggest both answers work as i expect but @Hendra Bundle Point seems easy and clear  and @cricket_007 code suggest avoid bundle i agree with him that bundle would be null when Fragment is created but just for app to work i updated log and code its sending data to fragment via bundle successfully but its comes with 2 more problems first as you can see <strong>recyclerview.setAdapter(adapter) throws null pointer</strong> and how can i set imagePath(URL of Image) to ImageView In adapter.

<strong>EDIT #3</strong> @Cricket_007 Suggested I added Interface and Wrapper Class but putting both string (Name[] and Image[]) Into List List=new ArrayList(); gives me hard time.So i used Noraml List Function and put both string into it then get it into onPostExecute.

When I do

<pre><code>context = JAXBContext.newInstance(""the.package.structure"");
unmarshaller = context.createUnmarshaller();
Bar object = (Bar) unmarshaller.unmarshal(""path-to-xml-document"");
</code></pre>

The Bar <code>object</code> only has one element in the collection, not 2. The <code>First</code> element is completly lost, when I try to do <code>object.getThings()</code>, its size is 1 and the only object inside the collection is an instance of <code>Second</code>. Can someone help me how can I achieve to get both objects in the collection? And if that's not possible, how can I achieve something similar to this?

The reason I'm doing this is that (in my project logic) every <code>Bobar</code>s things collection has a <code>First</code> in its collection, but not every <code>Bar</code> has a <code>Second</code> in its collection, and <code>Foo</code> is a generic class.

<h2>Edit:</h2>

When I change the order in my XML document, the output is different.

<pre><code>&lt;bobar&gt;
   &lt;second&gt;blablabla&lt;/second&gt;
   &lt;first&gt;blublublu&lt;/first&gt;
&lt;/bobar&gt;
</code></pre>

In this scenario, I get only an instance of <code>First</code> in the collection, and <code>Second</code> is lost. And changing the scenario more, I get interesting results:

<pre><code>public abstract class Foo {

   private List&lt;Thing&gt; things;

   public List&lt;Thing&gt; getThings() { return this.things; }
}

public abstract class Bar extends Foo {


   @XmlElements({@XmlElement(name = ""first"", type = First.class), @XmlElement(name = ""third, type = Third.class)})
   public List&lt;Thing&gt; getThings() { return super.getThings(); }

}

public class Bobar extends Bar {

   @XmlElements({@XmlElement(name = ""second"", type = Second.class)})
   public List&lt;Thing&gt; getThings() { return super.getThings(); }

}
</code></pre>

If I do

<pre><code>&lt;bobar&gt;
   &lt;third&gt;bliblibli&lt;/third&gt;
   &lt;second&gt;blablabla&lt;/second&gt;
   &lt;first&gt;blublublu&lt;/first&gt;
&lt;/bobar&gt;
</code></pre>

In theory, I think this shouldn't be validated against the XML Schema generated by that, as the order here is not correct. But besides that, in such scenario, I get <code>Second</code> and <code>First</code>, the <code>Third</code> is lost.

Disclaimer: I do not have PHP scripting knowledge nor a regular programmer on web techologies. Thus far whatever I achieved is through googling only. Please answer thinking me as beginner. Also bear with my long descriptions of usecase but i believe its important to describe my target and development setup

I have pjsua a command line based soft phone application compiled for Raspberry pi(see snapshot here <a href=""http://www.pjsip.org/pjsua.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pjsip.org/pjsua.htm</a>). This is console app, which after run, expects key board input from user. example 'm' to make calls , 'q' for quit etc. 

I have created a bash shell script in my home directory named 'pjsip' which has start() / stop() / restart() interfaces implemented and looks like:

<pre><code>DAEMON=""/usr/bin/pjsua""
DEFAULT=""/home/pi/pjsip_default""
START=""1""

. $DEFAULT ""$2""

case ""$1"" in
start)
    if [ ""$START"" = ""0"" ] ; then
        if test -z ""$OPTIONS"" ; then
            echo ""You have to define OPTIONS in $DEFAULT before running pjsip""
        fi
        exit 0
    fi

    echo -n ""Starting $DESC: ""
    $DAEMON $OPTIONS
    ;;
</code></pre>

This all is working when I run ./pjsip start  locally  on Raspberry pi. pjsip shell script invokes /usr/bin/pjsua with command line args in console mode. 

Next I setup apache web server on Raspberry pi and hosted a web page created in PHP which user can access from remote PC over internet and enter sip server IP details.Intention is when user press 'submit' button then backend softphone app(which is pjsua) running on server can be started/restarted with user passed-in details.

Now here is stuck point:

When user presses submit button, I am invoking a shell script 'pjsip' (as mentioned above) from a PHP page to starts my soft phone app with user passed in details using command 'shell_exec('/home/pi/pjsip',$output). I am able to invoke a shell script from php but with two problems:

1) it is directing all console output to php page - for this I commented out $echo output

2)it is killing itself with error ""Cannot switch back to console from file redirection"" - this is main error.

To resolve second problem rather than modifying a code, would like to ask is there any way in PHP to launch a backend app independently using shell script so that it once launched, remain active and kill/quit only when user intentionally press 'q' through keyboard? i.e. it should run in console mode only. 

Is it possible through PHP? If not, any other alternative way exists to solve problem?? 

In current implementation, my PHP script looks like:

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if($_SERVER[""REQUEST_METHOD""] == ""POST"")
{ $output = shell_exec('/home/pi/pjsip start');
      exit();
     }
?&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;form action = ""&lt;?php $_PHP_SELF ?&gt;"" method = ""POST""&gt;
         Name: &lt;input type = ""text"" name = ""IP"" /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
          &lt;input type = ""submit"" /&gt;
      &lt;/form&gt;

   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

In my program, I interact  and script together. I am using  to receive response(json data) from TCP server and save them into a file. In webview I am using script jQuery getJSON() function to retrieve that file and using jQuery plot chart library to draw chart. Now, there is no relationship between  and script. Every time when I update data and file, I still need to click a button in webview to trigger the draw function. I want the programmes to be smart and handy. Is that a way to call or execute script from . I know one way:

<pre><code>Button update = (Button)findViewById(R.id.update);
        update.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {

            @Override
            public void onClick(View v) {

                wv.loadUrl(""script:document.write('hello')"");
            }
        });

But the problem is I already do a index page by loadurl().

<pre><code>final WebView wv = (WebView) findViewById(R.id.webkankan);
        wv.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
        wv.loadUrl(""file:///android_asset/index.html"");
</code></pre>

When I trigger this click event, all contents were gone only a string ""hello"" there. Another thing is why I need to change webview's type to final to avoid eclipse error. Does this is the problem to trigger my main problem? If so, how can I fix it?
Thanks for you patience.

1495,2464950,"I looked under the hood for <code>EnumSet.allOf</code> and it looks very efficient, especially for enums with less than 64 values.

Basically all sets share the single array of all possible enum values and the only other piece of information is a bitmask which in case of <code>allOf</code> is set in one swoop.

On the other hand Enum.values() seems to be a bit of black magic. Moreover it returns an array, not a collection, so in many cases it must be decorated with Arrays.asList( ) to be usable in any place that expects collection.

So, should <code>EnumSet.allOf</code> be more preferable to <code>Enum.values</code>?

More specifically, which form of <code>for</code> iterator should be used:

<pre><code>for ( final MyEnum val: MyEnum.values( ) );
</code></pre>

or

<pre><code>for ( final MyEnum val: EnumSet.allOf( MyEnum.class ) );

1500,16621800,"I know there are lots of threads on this topic, but I could not find one that actually answers my question cohesively.

I worked on a code for an RSA algorithm and it returns the incorrect number, which happens to be huge. I am sure i coded everything right except for one line i was not sure about. I did not know how to solve for the private key in the RSA, and just winged it (i saw someone code 

<blockquote>
  d = e.modInverse(m);
</blockquote>

where d is the private key, e is the public key, and m is (p-1)*(q-1). I dont understand how the modInverse method works though. long story short, how do you actually solve for the 'd' without having 2 unknowns in the same equation (i saw some equations given that said:

<blockquote>
  d = 1/(e % m);

I refrained from posting results just because the number returned is about as big as the encrypted message.

However, when rendered the 3 bottom radio buttons are disabled.  I've tried changing just about all of the attributes to make them enabled but to no avail.

The only way I have managed to get them enabled is by adding this line:

<pre><code>&lt;h:inputHidden value=""#{flowState.selectedOption}"" id=""hiddenId"" /&gt;

Even this doesn't work fully though; selecting a radio button and going to the next page binds correctly.  However when I go back a page the radio buttons are disabled again!

I'm using the following CSV Parser settings:

<pre><code>CsvParserSettings parserSettings = new CsvParserSettings();
parserSettings.setLineSeparatorDetectionEnabled(true);
parserSettings.getFormat().setDelimiter('|');
parserSettings.setIgnoreLeadingWhitespaces(true);
parserSettings.setIgnoreTrailingWhitespaces(true);
parserSettings.setHeaderExtractionEnabled(false);
parserSettings.setMaxCharsPerColumn(4096);
</code></pre>

What I can infer from the exception is that in the second line I have a starting double quote (""). But the line does not ends with the double quote (""). 
So in this case the column length reaches till EOF(end of file).

1503,30642810,"On a project that enables the creation and management of calculation sheets, wherein each worksheet.

It has an owner and two sets of users: those who can change the spreadsheet and those who can read the spreadsheet. Every cell in a spreadsheet can have as a literal content, a reference to another cell of the same sheet or a function

Now suppose if you want to add the following requirements:

â¢ The application should now support a second type of reference: external reference.

In this case, the reference relates to a cell of a spreadsheet.

The reference external are represented by id row;! col, where id represents the identifier spreadsheet containing the desired cell (with the row address; col).

So that I have this source of code according to the domain:

<pre><code>class BubbleDocs{
    int nextDocumentId;
}

class User {
    String userToken;
    String username;
    String password;
    String name;
    String email;
}

class Session {
    DateTime LastAccess;
}

class SpreadSheet {
    int id;
    String spreadSheetName;
    String ownerUsername;
    LocalDate creationDate;
    int numberRows;
    int numberColumns;
}

class Access {
}

RemoteCellManager {
    int spreadSheetID;
    bool updated;
}

class Cell {
    int cellRow;
    int cellColumn;
    boolean protect;
}
</code></pre>

â¢ For scalability reasons, it may happen that the application is distributed
on multiple servers, each responsible for managing a subset of leaves
calculation.

For this reason, an external reference can not refer directly
the cell of another worksheet as it may happen that the two sheets
calculation in question (the one containing the external reference and referenced in the reference external) are on different servers. To resolve this issue goes away consider a new entity, RemoteCellManager.

An instance of this entity for server and this instance will manage all created external references in the context of spreadsheets associated with the server.

So whenever an external reference, a new type of entity to consider in the field is created, this should be recorded in this entity. For optimization reasons, each reference external keeps the value of the referenced external cell.

Where a cell is changed, all its external references should be updated. The entity 'RemoteCellManager' is responsible for performing this update.

To this solution I will should how the entities get 'RemoteCellManager' the information that a cell has changed and what its new value.

â¢ For performance reasons will be limited the number of external references

They can be created on a server.

This number is equal to 100.

My solution for this problem is based on having the next source of code:

<pre><code>class ExternalReference {
    int cellRow;
    int cellCol;
    int cellID;
}

class RemoteCellManager extends ExternalReference { }

relation ServerHasExternalReference {
    ExternalReference playsRole reference {
        multiplicity 0..100;
    }
}
</code></pre>

My question is, how can I make the relation between the Manager and the Server while the Manager has a relation to a reference?

From top to bottom i have the security-role-assignment which maps users from an ldap group to have the REGISTERED_USER. The tag session-descriptor i think is self explained. Then there is my apps context root context-root. And then some servlet definition that is used to register the servlet to Weblogic (this is also defined in web.xml and i think this will not need any more handling). 

So what is the best way to migrate this weblogic.xml file in my application?

<ol>
<li>I've created a Java application in NetBeans. The application runs without exceptions when running within NetBeans by clicking Run Main Project. The total duration of a complete run is about 1min.</li>
<li>When building the project I see the following option in the output window of NetBeans:

To run this application from the command line without Ant, try:

<pre><code> -jar ""C:\_libraries\PrxJobCommunicator\dist\PrxJobCommunicator.jar""
</code></pre></li>
<li>So i open the command prompt (Windows 7), enter this command + supply a mandatory integer argument and press enter</li>
<li>The application starts running, runs for a couple of seconds and exits without any message whatsoever.</li>
<li>the application writes to a text file at different points in the code, so I'm able to trace the output up to the point when it stops running. I've deliberately put some extra calls to the file writer method in order to find where the programme continues/exits but to no avail. Seemingly the programme simply stops running on a certain line and that's it. </li>
</ol>

I really don't know what the problem can be: the application runs fine in NetBeans and fails without any message whatsoever when starting from the command line.

Shall I check anything special in NetBeans? Do you know of any special technique to debug a jar file if it's started from the command line?

Any clues are welcome.
Thanks, Andras

1517,12691500,"it's my first time asking a question here so I'll try to stay on-topic. I'm trying to randomly generate a background by creating an appropriately-sized ArrayList of Bitmap objects, and drawing them in order. This implementation works fine loading a single Bitmap, by the way; it's just stumbling with a list.

Before I get to the code, I'd like to point out that Ideally I would make a single Bitmap by adding the individual pixels or tiles, and indeed have tried a few variations of that, but they all result in black screens; I'm starting to think it might be a problem with how I draw to the Canvas. Anyways, here's what I have:

First, I generate the random ArrayList, only using 3 colors right now. I'd make it return the list, but it's just a private method inside the thread referencing one of the thread's variables so it doesn't matter much.

<pre><code>    private void genMap(Resources res)
    {
        // Load basic tiles.
        Bitmap green = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, R.drawable.green);
        Bitmap red = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, R.drawable.red);
        Bitmap blue = BitmapFactory.decodeResource(res, R.drawable.blue);

                    // All tiles must be the same size.
        int tile_width = green.getWidth();
        int tile_height = green.getHeight();
        int num_x = mCanvasWidth / tile_width;
        int num_y = mCanvasHeight / tile_height;

        for (int j = 0; j &lt; num_y; j++)
        {
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; num_x; i++)
            {
                double r = Math.random();
                Bitmap tile;
                if (r &lt;= 1/3) {tile = green;}
                else if (r &lt;= 2/3) {tile = red;}
                else {tile = blue;}
                // Create a new Bitmap in order to avoid referencing the old value.
                mBackgroundImages.add(Bitmap.createBitmap(tile));
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>

So, that's how the random values are mapped to a pattern. The method is called in the thread's constructor, which is in turn called every time onCreate is called; for now, I'm just clearing the list and making a new random pattern each time:

<pre><code>...
Resources res = context.getResources();
mBackgroundImages = new ArrayList&lt;Bitmap&gt;();
genMap(res);
...
</code></pre>

And finally, the draw method; it works fine loading a single Bitmap via BitmapFactory.decodeResources, but shows a black screen when doing this:

<pre><code>    private void doDraw(Canvas canvas)
    {
        /* Draw the bg.
         * Remember, Canvas objects accumulate.
         * So drawn first = most in the background. */
        if (canvas != null)
        {
            if (mBackgroundImages.size() &gt; 0)
            {
                int tile_width = mBackgroundImages.get(0).getWidth();
                int tile_height = mBackgroundImages.get(0).getHeight();
                for (int y = 0; y &lt; mCanvasHeight / tile_height; y++)
                {
                    for(int x = 0; x &lt; mCanvasWidth / tile_width; x++)
                    {
                         // Draw the Bitmap at the correct position in the list; Y * XWIDTH + X, at pos X * XWIDTH, Y * YWIDTH.
                         canvas.drawBitmap(mBackgroundImages.get((x + y * (mCanvasWidth/tile_width))), x * tile_width, y * tile_height, null);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

I have spent several days, done some reasearch, tried different things, and asked the question below: 
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25620303/how-can-i-globally-set-flushmode-for-hibernate-4-3-5-final-with-spring-4-0-6"">How can I globally set FlushMode for Hibernate 4.3.5.Final with Spring 4.0.6?</a>

Seems like there are 2 solotions I can go with, but I have still not found the recommended approach.

Approach 1:

Implement a custom version of OpenSessionInViewFilter to set the default FlushMode to AUTO.

Approach 2:

Use a TransactionManager, and add the @Transactional annotation to every method that has write access to the database.
This can be done by following: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13087928/spring-hibernate-transaction-management"">Spring Hibernate transaction management</a>

<hr>

Could anyone provide any suggestion, or point out any documentation related to ""Starting from version x.x.x, this is how we should implement Hibernate now!""

Thanks a lot

1524,35347650,"Im a rookie Java coder, and I am trying to make a very basic username/password program. The username part of it is working fine, but when I get to the password it gives me some weird problems. I figured out that for example when it checks for an Uppercase letter, if it finds one its all good, but if it doesn't, it prints the error message for every single character in the password. It does this with the number check and the length check as well. If any of you guys could explain this to me rather simply since I am still new to , that would be awesome. Thanks!

It will happen at seemingly random times during the day. I checked to see if anything else was running on the machine, like scheduled backups or something, but found nothing. The machine has enough physical memory (2GB, with about 1GB free for a 3-500MB load), and has sufficient -Xmx specified. 

According to our sysadmin, the problem is that the RAM that the kernel uses as a disk cache (apparently all but 8MB) is not freed when the JVM needs to allocate memory, so the JVM process throws an OutOfMemoryError. This could be because Java asks the kernel if enough memory is available before allocating and finds that it is insufficient, resulting in a crash.

I would like to think, however, that Java simply tries to allocate the memory via the kernel, and when the kernel gets such a request, it makes room for the application by throwing our some of the disk cache.

Has anyone else run in to the issue, and if so, what was the error, and how did you solve it?

1536,16504140,"Why is Thread.stop() deprecated in Java. On their website, I see the following:

<blockquote>
  Why is Thread.stop deprecated?
  Because it is inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread causes it to unlock all the monitors that it has locked. (The monitors are unlocked as the ThreadDeath exception propagates up the stack.) If any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in an inconsistent state, other threads may now view these objects in an inconsistent state. Such objects are said to be damaged. When threads operate on damaged objects, arbitrary behavior can result. This behavior may be subtle and difficult to detect, or it may be pronounced. Unlike other unchecked exceptions, ThreadDeath kills threads silently; thus, the user has no warning that his program may be corrupted. The corruption can manifest itself at any time after the actual damage occurs, even hours or days in the future.

The hbm mapping XML file has

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0""?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping PUBLIC ""-//Hibernate/Hibernate Mapping DTD 3.0//EN""
""http://hibernate.sourceforge.net/hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd""&gt; 
</code></pre>

Searching on SO and Hibernate forums the fix looks like we need to make DTD in the doctype to SYSTEM so it reads from local system instead of public dtd hosted on sourceforge.net

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE hibernate-mapping SYSTEM ""hibernate-mapping-3.0.dtd""&gt;

But with this Hibernate is looking for the file on appserver root folder

1542,11071280,"I found this strange behaviour not only when debugging but also during normal execution (at least I imagine so, based on how the application acted).

If I use the following code (in a function that returns int):

<pre><code>try {
    return Integer.parseInt(""3"");
} catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

during debugging, after 'return Integer.parseInt(""3"");' the debugger jumps to 'return 0;'. It seems to be entering the catch block, but skips the System.out line and doesn't even show ""ex"" as an existing variable. Then the function returns 0.

But if I replace the above with the following:

<pre><code>int x;
try {
    x = Integer.parseInt(""3"");
} catch (NumberFormatException ex) {
    System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    x = 0;
}
return x;

then everything behaves as I'd expect it to: x gets the value of 3, and 3 is returned by the function.

For the good of me, I can't figure out why this happens. Do you have any idea?

I did them after seeing some stuff from internet. What are all the changes i have to do in my Category. class. For now, its looks like,

<pre><code>public class Category{
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
private int catId;
private String catName;

public Category() {
}

public int getCatId() {
    return this.catId;
}

public void setCatId(int catId) {
    this.catId = catId;
}

public String getCatName() {
    return this.catName;
}

public void setCatName(String catName) {
    this.catName = catName;
}

}
</code></pre>

I dont want to do mappings with xml config. I think, annotations is good for a beginner like me.

And my Old! SQL query looks like,

<code>SELECT EXPENSES.EXPNS_ID, EXPENSES.CAT_ID, EXPENSES.NAME, CATEGORY.CAT_NAME FROM EXPENSES INNER JOIN CATEGORY ON EXPENSES.CAT_ID = CATEGORY.CAT_ID WHERE USER_NAME=""+currentUserName</code>

How to use inner join in Hibernate?

Any Suggestions!!

Thanks!

<hr>

<strong>Update</strong>

Thanks for all answerers,
I tried what you told and it returns a empty list. 

To, test i set the 'userName=Tamil' which is in the table. 
The query generated by Hibernate is looks like below,

<code>select expens0_.expnsId as expnsId1_, expens0_.catId as catId1_, expens0_.category_catId as category7_1_, expens0_.userName as userName1_ from Expens expens0_ inner join Category category1_ on expens0_.category_catId=category1_.catId where expens0_.userName=?</code>

As a beginner, i have some doubts in JPQL, I want <code>catName</code> from <code>Category[catId, catName]</code> table. And the <code>catId</code> is also available in <code>Expens[expnsId, catId, userName]</code>. 

By adding the below lines in Expens. class, how it will give me <code>catName</code> along with the other variables in the <code>Expens</code> table. 

<pre><code>@ManyToOne
private Category category

// getters, setters
</code></pre>

I cant able to understand it. Without understanding this i cant move further, i have to give more mappings in my project. If clear with this mapping, i can move to the rest with confidence.

The query i used is pascal's version: <code>Query query = hSession.createQuery(""SELECT e FROM Expens e JOIN e.category c WHERE e.userName = :userName"").setParameter(""userName"", userName);</code>

For me, the query generated by hibernate is looks like same as my Old SQl query. I cant able to find problem here.

I used apache access log sampler. I followed this tutorial. 

<a href=""https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_accesslog_sampler_step_by_step.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/jmeter_accesslog_sampler_step_by_step.pdf</a>

I am able to make it work. But now the problem i replayed all the get requests in less than 10 mins.

I want jmeter to run the get requests based on the time stamp at which the get request is posted.

I am not able to find any such configuration online.

I can write script to curl the get request at that particular timestamp. But i want to use jmeter.

Is it possible.

<strong>EDIT</strong>

I created a sample csv file with below lines:

<pre><code>0,/myAPP/home
5000,/myAPP/home
5000,/myAPP/home

First i created a thread group as shown in image:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Yl2Fv.png"" alt=""enter image description here"">

Here i selected loop count forever. If not selected only first line in csv file is running.rest of the lines are not running.

Now i added csv data set config as shown in image:

Now i added HTTP request as shown in image:

I added view results tree listener and hit the play button. 

When i see the sample start in view result tree for each of the samples, the delay is not according to the delay present in csv file. What am i doing wrong.

<strong>EDIT2</strong>
I made the constant timer as child of the HTTP request. Please find the timings of the requests in the below screen shot. Do you see anything wrong .

<strong>EDIT3</strong>

I followed bean shell timre approach and it worked fine when the delay is greater than previous response time. But it didnt work properly when previous response time is greater than delay. 

I modified the csv file as below ( reduced delay to 100 msec)

<pre><code>0,/myAPP/home
100,/myAPP/home
100,/myAPP/home

I deleted constant timer and added below bean shell timer.

1557,12532150,"It is a complicated problem so I will explain it as clear as I can. I have three <code>OSGi</code> bundles <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> deployed into <code>Apache Karaf</code>. I also have a security bundle which is used by those <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, <code>C</code> bundles.

Each <code>A</code>, <code>B</code> and <code>C</code> bundles contains this:

<pre><code>&lt;osgi:reference id=""basicAuthHandlerFactory"" interface=""com.groupgti.security.handler.basicauth.BasicAuthHandlerFactory""/&gt;

&lt;bean id=""securityHandler"" class=""org.springframework.beans.factory.config.MethodInvokingFactoryBean""&gt;

    &lt;property name=""targetMethod"" value=""createSecurityHandler""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""arguments""&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;value type="".lang.String""&gt;A.realm&lt;/value&gt; &lt;!-- The realm is depending on a bundle, A.realm, B.realm, C.realm --&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

<code>Spring</code> code snippet to get the security handler from security bundle. This handler in security bundle is exposed as an <code>OSGi</code> service and created in the security bundle like this:

<pre><code>&lt;bean id=""securityHandler"" class=""org.eclipse.jetty.security.ConstraintSecurityHandler"" scope=""prototype""&gt;
    &lt;property name=""authenticator""&gt;
        &lt;bean class=""org.eclipse.jetty.security.authentication.BasicAuthenticator""/&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""constraintMappings""&gt;
        &lt;list&gt;
            &lt;ref bean=""constraintMapping""/&gt;
        &lt;/list&gt;
    &lt;/property&gt;
    &lt;property name=""strict"" value=""false""/&gt;
    &lt;property name=""identityService"" ref=""identityService""/&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean id=""basicAuthSecurityHandler"" class=""com.groupgti.security.handler.basicauth.BasicAuthFactoryHandlerImpl""/&gt;
&lt;osgi:service ref=""basicAuthSecurityHandler"" interface=""com.groupgti.security.handler.basicauth.BasicAuthHandlerFactory""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<code>BasicAuthFactoryHandlerImpl#createSecurityHandler(String realm)</code> is used to create the different instance of the security handler for each bundle. The realm is passed by the bundle when <code>createSecurityHandler</code> method is invoked by <code>Spring</code> <code>MethodInvokingFactoryBean</code> as showed in the above code.

The <code>securityHandler</code> <code>Spring</code> bean has a <code>scope</code> prototype, in which case when every call to the method <code>getBean</code> is called this should return a newly created object.

The realm I am setting for security handler is like this:

<pre><code>public class BasicAuthFactoryHandlerImpl implements BeanFactoryAware, BasicAuthHandlerFactory {

    private static final Logger LOGGER = LoggerFactory.getLogger(BasicAuthFactoryHandlerImpl.class);

    private BeanFactory factory;

    @Override
    public ConstraintSecurityHandler createSecurityHandler(String realm) {
        ConstraintSecurityHandler handler = (ConstraintSecurityHandler) factory.getBean(""securityHandler"");
        handler.setUserRealm(realm);
        LOGGER.debug(""Security handler created. Got realm: {}"", realm);
        return handler;
    }

    @Override
    public void setBeanFactory(BeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException {
        this.factory = beanFactory;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Handlers for each bundle gets created, everything is fine. But the problem is that the realm  for all bundles is somehow the same realm passed from the first started bundle. I am sure I am passing different realms in each <code>Spring</code> configuration in different bundles, but the realm is always from the first started bundle and it is not working correctly. 

Does anybody have an idea where might be the problem?

So my question to the experts out there is what is a good way to separate content from the code and maintain it independently without resorting to a large scale CMS? There has to be some sort of middle ground that allows me to change content without having to redeploy the code or go through the other extreme with some large CMS. I don't need all that workflow or versioning stuff etc. Maybe there is an open source library or API that allows you to manage content in a simple way. So what are the opinions out there?

Could you quickly explain me, how to mock Report - this is complicated class, and I want to keep original code from GetDataFromSQL method. 

Or may I have to do something with Tomcat?

1571,22988070,"I am facing a problem that looks similar to the one exposed in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15135363/solving--classpath-hell-in-legacy-junit-test-suite"">this question</a>, but I think different and hopefully easier to solve.

I have a unit test class <code>TestMyClass</code> that tests <code>MyClass</code>, and <code>MyClass</code> happens to have a static reference to a log4j logger.

When I run <code>TestMyClas</code>s with<code>@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)</code>, the initialization of the logger goes fine. But when I run the test with <code>@RunWith(PowerMockRunner.class)</code>, the following error is logged by log4j while initializing the logger:

<blockquote>
  log4j:ERROR A ""org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator"" object is not assignable to a ""org.apache.log4j.spi.Configurator"" variable.<br/>
  log4j:ERROR The class ""org.apache.log4j.spi.Configurator"" was loaded by <br/>
  log4j:ERROR [org.powermock.core.classloader.MockClassLoader@1ad186f] whereas object of type <br/>
  log4j:ERROR ""org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator"" was loaded by [sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader@13f5d07].<br/>
  log4j:ERROR Could not instantiate configurator [org.apache.log4j.xml.DOMConfigurator].
</blockquote>

I found out that this happens because the following snippet returns <code>false</code> in the log4j initialization code:

<pre><code>Configurator.class.isAssignableFrom(DOMConfigurator.class)
</code></pre>

This should be true, <code>DomConfigurator</code> implements <code>Configurator</code>, but I think it returns false because I happen to have two versions of these classes on the classpath: one from log4j-1.2.14 and one from log4j-extras-1.1. And I suppose that when the test is run with <code>PowerMockRunner</code>, the two classes are not loaded from the same jar (let me know if there could be another reason).

So I would like to understand:

<ul>
<li>Why do I face this issue? Why does the classpath order differs depending on the JUnit runner used? Isn't it supposed to be deterministic?</li>
<li>Is there any way to get around this?</li>
</ul>

<strong>N.B.:</strong> I have to use <code>PowerMockRunner</code>, because I need to mock a static call. I cannot get rid of one of the log4j jars, because both of them are dependencies of a dependency of my project. This issue does not make my tests fail, it just prints those errors, but still it would be nice to have it solved.

Originally in book paths were like:

<pre><code>&lt;PARAM name=""SRC"" VALUE=""c:\Program Files\QuickTime\Sample.mov""&gt;
</code></pre>

and 

<pre><code>&lt;EMBED SRC=""file://c:\Program Files\QuickTime\Sample.mov"" WIDTH=""320""
HEIGHT=""250"" AUTOPLAY=""true"" CONTROLLER=""true""
PLUGINSPAGE=""http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/""&gt;
</code></pre>

So I changed that to reflect Windows 7 64 bit program path.
It didn't work. Then I moved Sample.mov to C:\Sample.mov and updated paths in code as well, but that didn't work either? Then I moved Sample.mov to same folder where is html, updated paths just to ""Sample.mov"" without ""C:\"". And it worked. I tried all possible combinations prior to that ( / or // or \ or file:///C:/... etc). But it works only without any path.

So in order to make QuickTime video opening in both IE and Firefox I ended up with this:

<pre><code>&lt;OBJECT CLASSID=""clsid:02BF25D5-8C17-4B23-BC80-D3488ABDDC6B"" WIDTH=""320"" HEIGHT=""250""

    &lt;PARAM name=""SRC"" VALUE=""Sample.mov""&gt;
    &lt;PARAM name=""AUTOPLAY"" VALUE=""true""&gt;
    &lt;PARAM name=""CONTROLLER"" VALUE=""true""&gt;

    &lt;EMBED SRC=""Sample.mov"" WIDTH=""320"" HEIGHT=""250"" 
           AUTOPLAY=""true"" CONTROLLER=""true"" PLUGINSPAGE=""http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/""&gt;
&lt;/OBJECT&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>QUESTION 1 IS: how should I make it work with file located outside of document root, like it was supposed in genuine example.</strong>

Unfortunately, I can't make  clock work. I also tried every combination but browser just don't ""see"" JavaClock class? No matter if I tun it from IDE (Netbeans of directly by opening HTMK page from browser (IE, Firefox or Chrome). Browsers are complaining that JavaClock.class doesn't exist?

<strong>QUESTION 2 IS: how should I make that JavaClock class work as well?.</strong>

1578,33476910,"This started to happen to me and all my teammates at some point and we cannot figure out what is that triggered that and how to solve that.<br>
We all have the same Java projects in our workspaces. In <code>Project</code> menu we all have <code>Build automatically</code> ticked.<br>
Let's say that my workspace has no compilation errors. I make a trivial change to one of the Java classes, I save, Eclipse starts rebuilding and the result is that hundreds of classes - in more than one project - have now compilation errors. That is because for some reason a lot of <code>import</code> statements now show the error <em>The import [xxx] cannot be resolved</em>.<br>
But those <code>import</code>s (and the whole workspace for that matter) were perfectly error-free before I saved my trivial, completely unrelated change, and they all go back to being perfectly error-free if at this point I just do <code>Project / Clean</code> which of course triggers a workspace rebuild.

The <code>.log</code> file in the workspace folder doesn't show anything; if it's empty before I save, it's still empty after my save caused those errors to appear.

This is way more annoying than it might sound, because building the whole workspace can take minutes, and since a mere <code>Project / Clean</code> makes all failing <code>import</code>s work again this cannot be due to something wrong in our code.

I know this is a long shot but considering how reproducible this issue is for us (100% of the times on 100% of the several computers involved) maybe someone else had the same problem and discovered the cause or a solution.

The version is <em>Eclipse Java EE IDE for Web Developers</em>, Mars.1 Release (4.5.1), on Windows 8.

We use Gradle (2.6) by creating External Tool Configurations that point to <code>gradlew.bat</code> and with a string prompt. We run those manually to configure the projects after importing them into Eclipse (by entering <code>eclipse</code> in the string prompt) and to build the JARs for the deployment (by entering <code>build</code> in the string prompt), however I don't think Gradle is involved in the problematic build by Eclipse.

<strong>ADDED:</strong> I'm no longer sure it's accurate to say that this problem is 100% reproducible, because the following happens:

<ul>
<li>Initial state: no errors present (which can only be because I cleaned all projects) and no unsaved changes.</li>
<li>I make a change to a class in the editor, I save and that generates the errors.</li>
<li>I undo that change, save and clean; so I'm back to exactly the initial state.</li>
<li>I redo that change (identical), I save and this time I don't get the errors.</li>
</ul>

<strong>ADDED:</strong> Using <code>p</code> to inspect the generated <code>.class</code> files, I notice the 2 following things:

1) Minor and major versions are always the same no matter the <code>.class</code> file got built with the errors or without (minor version: 0; major version: 51). Of course when the <code>.class</code> file is built with the errors it contains the error messages while when it's built without the errors it doesn't contain the error messages.

2) Comparing the outputs of <code>p</code> for both <code>.class</code> files, I see that in the ""Constant pool"" section the lines are identical (showing names of class members and objects, f.ex. <code>L/lang/String;</code>) up until a line about a class <code>my.package.MyClassImpl</code> where the problematic <code>.class</code> file has  

<code>#32 = Utf8               LMyClassImpl;</code>  

and the correct <code>.class</code> file has the same but fully qualified:  

<code>#32 = Utf8               Lmy.package.MyClassImpl;</code>

I'm sure this has to do with the problem.

<strong>ADDED:</strong> <strong>The problem disappears</strong> if I tick the â<em>Rebuild class files modified by others</em>â checkbox in Eclipse preferences under <code>Java / Compiler / Building / Output folder</code>. At least all the cases where a certain change was showing the problem don't show it any longer.
This is just a workaround and I'm keeping investigating the root cause, however this hints strongly towards <a href=""http://help.eclipse.org/mars/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Fconcepts%2Fconcept--builder.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">Eclipseâs internal Java compiler</a> playing a major role in this problem.

<strong>ADDED:</strong> Below is the content of the <code>.classpath</code> and <code>.project</code> files of two of the projects. The first project is one that shows those compilation errors. The second project is one that never does. I had to replace many lines with <code>....</code> in one file because of the 30.000 chars limit and I can't seem to be able to find how to attach files; if that is allowed and someone points me to how to do that I will attach them without cuts and remove their content from the question.  

Note the interesting difference that the first <code>.classpath</code> has an entry <code>excluding=""**/*.class""</code> and the second doesn't. However when I modify the Java Build Path of all the projects that have that <em>through Eclipse (Project Properties / Java Build Path / Source)</em> removing their <code>excluded:**/*.class</code> the resulting <code>.classpath</code> files don't have that entry but the compilation errors appear anyway (also after restarting Eclipse). And if I do the opposite (i.e. add <code>excluded:**/*.class</code> to all projects that don't have it) then the <code>.classpath</code> files of all the projects get that entry but the compilation errors still show up. I would have bet that this would solve the problem but it doesn't.

1586,34095580,"1) The code at the bottom is part of a introduction to JOGL which is just openGL for  and I can't quite understand the usage of ""this"" here. I have used it before and researched it point to point in many uses but I don't understand how its used in <strong>this particular context</strong>, so please don't direct me to another ""this"" explanation as I've read them already.

For example, below, the bit that is:

<pre><code>public S1_original() {

        this.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT);

What is the ""this"" keyword referring to here? I didn't write any other classes, so what is it using "".setSize()"" method to?

2) If I were to NOT use ""this"" in the example above with ""this.setSize(WIDTH, HEIGHT) what would I put there? 

3) What is ""this"" referring to in this code then?

<pre><code>canvas.addGLEventListener(this);

Why did similar lines need a ""this"" before it but here its using this inside as a parameter.

<pre><code>public class S1_original extends Frame implements GLEventListener {

Exception in thread ""AWT-EventQueue-0"" .lang.NullPointerException
    at x.swing.ImageIcon.&lt;init&gt;(Unknown Source)....
</code></pre>

So I decompressed the jar and looked at the directory structure within it and I was surprised to see that my ""images"" package was included in an unwanted ""src"" directory, making it impossible for the jvm to find them.

So here is the original project structure in Eclipse:

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/YDtVU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">

and here is the directory structure in the unpacked jar :

<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/4htDf.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here"">

(the images directory is under the ""src"" directory which prevents the jvm from finding the pics)

Any idea about how to solve that ?

1590,33276540,"Right now I'm creating an RSS reader and primarily just trying to get items's title and description to display on the ListView. I tested it without RSS data earlier and confirmed that the app properly lists items I created. However after attempting the same with data from an RSS, I'm encountering issues with retrieving the actual RSS data as well how to use the doinBackground method. 

After reading Google's documentation regarding doinBackground, I understand that it's class (Async) allows for background operations to be performed and have their results displayed in the UI thread.

I have no clue how to avoid this problem. I tried changing the idle timeout, active passive transfer mode, binary or ascii mode (which probably would not be a good idea for picture files). Unfortunately the exception still is thrown. But when transfer the files with FileZilla there is no problem. So i can exclude that the server makes the mistake.<br>
Anybody can help me?  

Thanks in advance

<hr>

To track the problem down i changed the method to retrieve the file from  

<pre><code>ftpC.retrieveFile(strCurrentPictureName, fosPicture);
</code></pre>

to  

<pre><code>int iCount;
byte[] content=new byte[4096];
InputStream isContent=null;
isContent=ftpC.retrieveFileStream(strCurrentPictureName);
while((iCount=isContent.read(content))!=-1)
{
  if(iCount&gt;0 &amp;&amp; logEr.isDebugEnabled())
    logEr.debug(iCount+"" chars read);
}
ftpC.completePendingCommand();
isContent.close();
</code></pre>

Now the behavior is, that the system starts to read from the stream, but very very slowy. Here is the output of the logfile:

<pre><code>2013-04-18 19:18:00,298 [main] DEBUG ag.oase.gastrodb.jobs.WKKImport - 1144 chars read

</code></pre>

As you can see, 1144 Bytes took 5 sec to be read which calculates down to a speed of 0,22 kB/s which is not normal. When i open an command ftp client to transfer the same file with the same user from the same server on the same client the speed shows: 331127 bytes received in 0.11 secs (2967.1 kB/s)

So the bottleneck somewhere resides in Java or the commons.net package?
Or in my code :-)

I appreciate every help.<br>

While syntactically valid XML, it's necessary (due to a downstream consumer) that I preserve the newlines.  The above XML will instead be normalized to <code>a b c</code> by that consumer (and indeed, by StAX itself--if I take this output and feed it back into the same program, the second time it will output <code>baz=""a b c ""</code>). 

While I've given up on <code>XMLEventWriter</code> preserving non-semantic formatting, is there a way to prevent it from essentially changing my attribute values?

I am using the datastax  driver for Apache Cassandra (v. 2.1.9) and I am wondering what should happen when I set replication_factor greater than number of nodes. I've read somewhere that Cassandra allows for this operation, but should fail when I will try to save some data (of course it depends on the write consistency level, but I mean the case of ALL).<br />
The problem is that everything works, no exception is being thrown, even if I try to save data. Why?<br />
Maybe the pieces of information which I've read were old, for older versions of Cassandra?

I'm trying to create a small 2D game for Android and I am having some problems using SurfaceView.

My main activity currently looks like this:

<pre><code>public class MainActivity extends Activity {

private static final String TAG = ""MainActivity"";
private DrawingSurface drawingsurface;
private Game game;

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    Log.d(TAG, ""onCreate()"");

    setFullscreen();
    game = new Game();
    drawingsurface = new DrawingSurface(this, game);
    setContentView(drawingsurface);
}

private void setFullscreen() {
    // ...
}
</code></pre>

}

As you can see, I set my activity to fullscreen, create a new SurfaceView (called drawingSurface) and create a new game instance.

My SurfaceView (called DrawingSurface) looks like this:

<pre><code>public class DrawingSurface extends SurfaceView implements SurfaceHolder.Callback {

private GameThread thread;
private static final String TAG = ""DrawingSurface"";


public DrawingSurface(Context context, Game game) {
    super(context);
    getHolder().addCallback(this);
    setFocusable(true);
    // create a new game rendering thread and pass it game so it can call the update() and render() functions of game:
    thread = new GameThread(getHolder(), this, game); 
}

@Override
public void surfaceCreated(SurfaceHolder holder) {
    Log.v(TAG, ""surfaceCreated()"");
    // start the rendering thread:
    thread.setRunning(true);
    thread.start();
}

@Override
public void surfaceChanged(SurfaceHolder holder, int format, int width, int height) {
    Log.v(TAG, ""surfaceChanged()"");
    // do I need to do anything in here?
}

@Override
public void surfaceDestroyed(SurfaceHolder holder) {
    // stop the rendering thread:
    Log.v(TAG, ""surfaceDestroyed()"");
    thread.setRunning(false);
    boolean retry = true;
    while (retry) {
        try {
            thread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            // try again shutting down the thread
        }
    }
}

@Override
public boolean onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
    // pass the touch event to the Game instance (to keep everything in on place)
    thread.game.onTouchEvent(event);
    return super.onTouchEvent(event);
}

@Override
protected void onDraw(Canvas canvas) {
    // I don't use onDraw(), instead I have my own update() and render() functions in my game thread

And this is the Game class:

public class Game {

<pre><code>private static final String TAG = ""Game"";

private int playerY = 0;
private int playerVelY = 1;

public Game() {
    Log.v(TAG, ""Game instance created"");
}

public void update(long dt) {
    playerY += playerVelY * dt;
    if (playerY &gt; 1800) {
        playerVelY = -playerVelY;
    }
    if (playerY &lt; 0) {
        playerVelY = -playerVelY;
    }

}
public void render(Canvas canvas, long dt) {
    canvas.drawColor(Color.BLACK);
    // draw Player
    Paint paint = new Paint();
    paint.setTextSize(100);
    paint.setColor(new Color().rgb(255, 0, 0));
    canvas.drawRect(playerRefPosX, playerY + 100, playerRefPosX + 200, playerY - 100, paint);
    canvas.drawText(String.valueOf(1000/dt), canvas.getWidth()/2, canvas.getWidth()/2, paint);
}

public void onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event) {
    Log.v(TAG, ""received touch event.."");
}
</code></pre>

}

The problems I am have right now:

<ul>
<li>When I press the home button and reenter the app OR rotate my device it calls surfaceDestroyed() but doesn't recreate it afterwards (the canvas doesn't get repainted)</li>
<li>The game rendering thread never stops (as indicated by the log messages)</li>

I compile it with:

<pre><code>$ c -classpath :/usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/hadoop-core-1.0.3.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar:/home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar -d myc/ SeqPrep.
</code></pre>

I jar it:

<pre><code>$ jar -cvf SeqPrep.jar -C myc/ .
</code></pre>

Now I'd like to run it on my local hadoop node. I've tried:

<pre><code> hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep
</code></pre>

But I get:

<pre><code>Exception in thread ""main"" .lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/mahout/math/Vector

    at .lang.Class.forName(Class.:247)
    at org.apache.hadoop.util.RunJar.main(RunJar.:149)

So I tried using the libjars parameter: 

<pre><code>$ hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/core/target/mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/math/target/mahout-math-0.8-SNAPSHOT.jar -libjars /home/hduser/mahout/trunk/math/target/mahout-math-0.8-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
</code></pre>

and got the same problem. I don't know what else to try.

My eventual goal is to be able to read a .csv file on the hadoop fs into a sparse matrix and then multiply it by a random vector.

<strong>edit:</strong> Looks like Razvan got it (note: see below for another way to do this that does not mess with your hadoop installation). For reference:

<pre><code>$ find /usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/. |grep mah

and then:

<pre><code>$hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep

small round green apple , small round green apple:{0:0.11,1:510.0,2:1.0}
</code></pre>

<strong>edit:</strong>  I'm trying to do this without coing the mahout jars into the hadoop lib/

<pre><code>$ rm /usr/local/hadoop-1.0.3/lib/mahout-*
</code></pre>

and then of course:

<pre><code>hadoop jar SeqPrep.jar org.help.SeqPrep

Exception in thread ""main"" .lang.ClassNotFoundException: SeqPrep.jar
</code></pre>

<strong>edit:</strong> Apparently I can only send one jar at a time to hadoop. This means I need to add the class I made into the mahout core job file:

<pre><code>~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ cp mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar_backup

~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ cp ~/workspace/seqprep/bin/org/help/SeqPrep.class .

Exception in thread ""main"" .lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.help.SeqPrep

<strong>edit:</strong> Ok, now I can do it without messing with my hadoop installation. I was updating the .jar wrong in that previous edit. It should be:

<pre><code>~/mahout/trunk/core/target$ jar uf mahout-core-0.8-SNAPSHOT-job.jar org/help/SeqPrep.class

then:

1612,18307420,"I have a situation where I need to create a FutureTask with a Callable that checks if it's owner has been cancelled. The code I have looks like this:

    return new FutureTask&lt;Result&gt;(new Callable&lt;Result&gt;() {

Basically the <code>doNetworkRequest</code> asks the <code>CarryOnCallback</code> if it should continue at certain times during the operation. I would like for this callback to see if the <code>FutureTask</code> that is calling the <code>doNetworkRequest</code> was cancelled, which involves querying the actual <code>FutureTask</code> object.

Now I know that you can't really access 'this' because it hasn't been constructed yet. But is there a way around this, or a better design for my situation?

Cheers

<strong>EDIT:</strong>

Ok so I'm going about it like this now. Made a custom Callable and FutureTask. The Callable holds a reference to the FutureTask and this can be set manually after creating a new Callable:

<pre><code>public static MyTask makeMyTask(final Call call, final TaskCompletionCallback completion) {
    MyTask task = null;
    MyTask.InnerCallable innerCallable = new MyTask.InnerCallable(call, completion);
    task = new MyTask(innerCallable);
    innerCallable.setParent(task);
    return task;
}
</code></pre>

And just for reference, the <code>InnerCallable</code> looks like this:

<pre><code>public static class MyTask extends FutureTask&lt;Result&gt; {

    InnerCallable callable;

    public MyTask(InnerCallable callable) {
        super(callable);
        this.callable = callable;
    }

    private static class InnerCallable implements Callable&lt;Result&gt; {

        private final Call call;
        private final TaskCompletionCallback completion;
        private WeakReference&lt;MyTask&gt; parentTask;

        InnerCallable(Call call, TaskCompletionCallback completion) {
            this.call = call;
            this.completion = completion;
        }

        @Override
        public Result call() {
            Result result = CYLib.doNetworkRequest(this.call, new CarryOnCallback() {
                @Override
                public boolean shouldCarryOn() {
                    MyTask task = parentTask.get();
                    return !(task == null || task.isCancelled());
                }
            });

            return result;
        }

        private void setParent(MyTask parentTask) {
            this.parentTask = new WeakReference&lt;MyTask&gt;(parentTask);
        }
    }

1613,34557460,"I'm using Spring Boot and Thymeleaf in a multi-tenant application. I am also using Thymeleaf to process email templates and generate html email. In order to do this, I created a <code>ITemplateResolver</code> that retrieves thymeleaf templates prefixed with ""db:"" from a database. 

Spring Boot auto-configuration picks up any template-resolvers and adds them the the <code>SpringTemplateEngine</code>. So I have a my template resolver set up like this:

<pre><code>@Bean
@Scope(value = ""tenant"", proxyMode = ScopedProxyMode.INTERFACES)
public ITemplateResolver databaseTemplateResolver() {

    final DatabaseTemplateResolver resolver = 
        new DatabaseTemplateResolver(systemSettingService, emailTemplateService );

    resolver.setTemplateMode(""HTML5"");
    resolver.setCacheTTLMs((long) (1000*60*5)); // 5 Minutes
    resolver.setOrder(2);

    return resolver;
}
</code></pre>

As expected, the resolver gets added to the <code>TemplateEngine</code> and any templates with names that start with ""db:"" are read from the database. This allows us to store specialized email templates that are processed by the Thymeleaf engine to produce the resulting html.

This worked very well, so it seemed. The scope specified above is a custom scope defined for one tenant in a multi-tenant environment determined by the domain. But this might as well be session scoped, I believe, for the purpose of this question. My thought here is that TemplateResolver is different for each scope. We need it to be because we are reading from the tenant's database for the template.

Finally, my symptom: It seems that the <em>first</em> tenant works fine. For any subsequent tenants, I get an exception when attempting to process a database template. 

<pre><code>org.thymeleaf.exceptions.NotInitializedException: Template Resolver has not been initialized

</code></pre>

I've tried disabling Spring Boot auto-configuration for Thymeleaf and manually setting up the TemplateEngine, ViewResolver, TemplateResolvers, etc. but have the same problem. I also tried making everything <code>tenant</code> scope but ran into an entirely different mess and back-tracked. 

I have a feeling that I'm doing something wrong, or have the wrong idea, of how dependency injection should work in this situation. Or the Thymeleaf engine is implemented in such a way that it is not compatible with the proxy object. I'm leaning towards the latter. Perhaps I need to somehow extend the template engine so that it initializes the resolvers once for each tenant? I believe, maybe, Thymeleaf thinks the resolver is already initialized, then when spring injects a new resolver, it is never initialized by Thymeleaf and hence the exception.

Can anyone give me a push in the right direction?  Thank you.

<strong>EDIT:</strong>
Here is the code for Thymeaf's <code>TemplateEngine</code> method <code>initialize()</code> which is called before any templates are processed. 

<pre><code>/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   Internal method that initializes the Template Engine instance. This method 
 *   is called before the first execution of {@link #process(String, IContext)} 
 *   in order to create all the structures required for a quick execution of 
 *   templates.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   THIS METHOD IS INTERNAL AND SHOULD &lt;b&gt;NEVER&lt;/b&gt; BE CALLED DIRECTLY.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 *   If a subclass of &lt;tt&gt;TemplateEngine&lt;/tt&gt; needs additional steps for
 *   initialization, the {@link #initializeSpecific()} method should
 *   be overridden.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 */
public final synchronized void initialize() {

    if (!isInitialized()) {

        logger.info(""[THYMELEAF] INITIALIZING TEMPLATE ENGINE"");

        this.configuration.initialize();

        this.templateRepository = new TemplateRepository(this.configuration);

        initializeSpecific();

        this.initialized = true;

        // Log configuration details
        this.configuration.printConfiguration();

        logger.info(""[THYMELEAF] TEMPLATE ENGINE INITIALIZED"");

    }

}
</code></pre>

In <code>this.configuration.initialize();</code>, various engine configuration is initialized. Among other things, the method initializes ( <strong>calls initialize()</strong> ) on all <code>TemplateResolver</code>s and then marks the engine as <strong>initialized</strong>.

Once the <code>TemplateEngine</code> is marked ""initialized,"" the engine will not be initialized again, nor will any configuration be initialized (by design). So I am thinking that maybe my thought is correct that a new <code>TemplateResolver</code> injected for a new scope will never be initialized. Or, more accurately, it will not be marked as initialized. 

It seems that one of the major reasons for the use of all these <code>initialized</code> flags it to keep from running before complete configuration and to prevent changes to configuration once running.

With what I found, and using the above assumptions, I changed my <code>TemplateResolver</code> to always check for initialization before every template is processed. This brute force method appears to work and does not seem to interfere with the intent of the Thymeleaf authors. (Based on my guess, of course. I really do not know. I am hoping.)

I have this to start things off:

1629,15656880,"I am writing an application (basically eclipse plugin), so there are few combo-box, drop-downs  etc, which I am getting values for them dynamically via XML file. My doubt is which is the best way to store these files in a particular directory so that it can be read in both Windows as well as Linux.

Initially I tried to create a config path under <code>{eclipse.home.location}</code> like:

<pre><code>String finalPath = System.getProperty(""eclipse.home.location"") +""/myAppConfig"";
</code></pre>

and store all of my plugin's configuration there (not only configuration but few helper jars which I programatically read in my plugin). But there is a probabilty that Eclipse installation maybe in shared location and user may not have write access to it.

I also tried to store it in a program files directory using:

<pre><code>System.getenv(""ProgramFiles"");
</code></pre>

But this fails under non-windows environments. So my question is can anyone shed a light on this so that I can store in some common directory where it is valid for both windows and linux?
Kindly let me know if my wordings are confusing. Or is it possible to store my config files under <code>plugins</code> directory and get the path like this <code>/plugins/myConfigDir</code> ?

1631,30293380,"I have developed and deployed a JSP/Servlet  web app on Google App Engine. The web app makes http requests to a third-party web site to retrieve data via REST services and show the data on the client side to the user who accesses my web app via ""appspot"". So it does not store any data on Google Cloud.

I would have to stick with the free plan of Google Cloud due to limited budget. The free plan allows up to 28 hours of frontend instance hours. According to the Google App Engine doc, 

<blockquote>
  Instance usage is billed by instance uptime, at a given hourly rate.
  Billable time starts when an instance starts, and ends fifteen minutes
  after it shuts down.
</blockquote>

I am wondering:

if an instance is able to handle multiple requests from the client side within the first fifteen mins of its uptime.

What is the maximum number of requests an instance can handle from its uptime?

How is that related to the ""Frontend Instance Hours"" (28 hrs) quota? What is the best practice to measure how many requests (users) my web app is able to handle per day?

In my particular case, are requests sent from the web app to the 3rd-party website included in the quota?

If I set the parallel option, mine tests fails cause of <code>DirtiesContexts</code>. (Even if I annotate the testclasses with <code>@DirtiesContext(classMode=ClassMode.AFTER_CLASS)</code>)

I'm not putting the stacktrace here but its failed to load applicationcontext cause he can't register the applicationcontext cause its already there.

If I use reusefork it tests succeeds even without annotating the <code>DirtiesContext</code>.

When you use reusefork you will create always new VM for each fork (and that's the reason why it is succesfull).
(see doc here : <a href=""http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html"">http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/test-mojo.html</a>)

With parallel you will not do this so normally this would have less resources needed.

1641,10533000,"I am trying to create a console that would work as a shell for a custom programming language. It would be very similar to the dev interactive console.

Currently, my RCP uses the basic TextConsole and is connected to the shell via pipes so it just displays whatever the shell displays and if the user enters anything in the RCP console, the same is written in the shell.

I want to be able to do a bit more such as move the caret position, add events for up and down arrow keys etc. I believe to do that I need to add a StyledText widget to the console which is done via the ConsoleViewer.

So my question is, that is there any way for me to either override the TextConsole's ConsoleViewer or if I were to extend TextConsole and create my own, then how do I link it with the launch configuration (the one that connects the shell via pipes)?

Also, to get the current default console I use <code>DebugUITools.getConsole(process)</code>.

I'm sorry if I haven't put all the information needed; it is a bit difficult to explain. I am hap to add more information.

An idea...
From what I understand I can create a <code>TextConsolePage</code> from the <code>TextConsole</code> using <code>createPage(ConsoleView)</code>. Once I have the page I can set the viewer via <code>setViewer(viewer)</code>. Here I thought if I create my own viewer (which will have the appropriate stylewidget) then that could be a lead. The only problem is that the viewer needs a Composite and I can't seem to figure out where to get that from.

Since you can only extend one class, interfaces seem much more flexible many of them can be implemented by one class.

Of course this does not work, because Hibernate ignores the Inheritance Hierarchy and doesn't like the fact that PartNumber is abstract.  <strong>Is there some way to do this using JPA or Hibernate Annotations?</strong>  I have tried using the @Inheritance JPA annotation.

I am not able to refactor the ""PartNumber"" part of the hierarchy because the original Developer wants to be able to extend PartNumber with N many XXXXPartNumber classes.

1652,34075810,"I have a very complex app that is leaking memory.  In order to track down the leak I stripped the launcher app to a very simple Android app which is still leaking an activity upon navigation to the next activity.  I found the leak using the hprof analyzer in Android studio.  The entire stripped down launcher activity is: 

<pre><code>import android.app.Activity;
import android.content.Intent;
import android.os.Bundle;
import android.view.View;
import android.widget.Button;

public class HomeTest extends Activity {

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.main);
    Button btnStaffStart = (Button)findViewById(R.id.btnStaffStart);

    btnStaffStart.setOnClickListener(new View.OnClickListener() {
        @Override
        public void onClick(View v) {


            Intent startNewActivityOpen = new Intent(HomeTest.this, StaffMenu.class);
            startActivity(startNewActivityOpen);

            finish();
        }

    });
}


}
</code></pre>

When I navigate to the StaffMenu activity, the analyzer shows a leak of the HomeTest Activity.  What, if anything, am I doing wrong or does the launching activity always leak memory in Android?  I'm not getting an OutOfMemory error message, I just don't like to be leaking memory. The app is not allocating much memory so the free memory is very minimal, even in the stripped down activity (less than 1%).   

I'm running Android 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1.

<strong>EDIT</strong>
I just tried another application and it also leaked the launcher activity after navigation to the next activity.  Known android bug???

1653,33314330,"I'm trying to improve my understanding of IO. So as I understand it, 'in' is a member variable of the System class. 

I believe it's a reference variable due to its type being 'InputStream' as mentioned at <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/se/7/docs/api//lang/System.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/se/7/docs/api//lang/System.html</a>

However, 'InputStream' is an abstract class so it cannot be instantiated. 

I've done some testing and came to conclusion that although you cannot instantiate an abstract class, you can create a reference variable of an abstract class type.  So my first question is there a purpose for this, if not, why is it allowed? 

<pre><code>Example: 

abstract class Someclass {
;
}

Someclass variable; // A field member of some another class. What purpose could it serve? 
</code></pre>

So here comes my second batch of related questions. What does system.in variable contain (or references) ? It surely is not 

InputStream in = new InputStream();

because it's an abstract class. Does this mean it has an instance of some child subclass? If so, which one? Is there a way to view the 'body' of field popular variables and methods online? 

Thanks for your help. 

<strong>Edit:</strong> Duplicate suggestions did not resolve the issue. The only thing I got a grasp of is that InputStream maybe instantiated with the BufferedStream class.

Questions below still stand: 

1.) Is there a way to view the 'body' of field popular variables and methods online? 
2.) Why is it allowed to make a reference of abstract class and what's the purpose of it?

3.) And the new question that rose as a sequence of the suggestions - why is it <code>InputStream in = new BufferedStream()</code> instead of <code>BufferedStream in = new BufferedStream()</code>

1654,9583370,"<em><strong>This problem has been solved witht he help of the comments:</em></strong>

It was necessary to recompile the  with the correct target version. In my case <code>c -source 1.3 -target 1.3</code> instead of simply <code>c</code> did the trick.

<strong>Problem Description:</strong>

I have a compiled .jar  program in which a single url string needs to be modified. Using JD I was able to decompile the code and make the changes.

As I would like to avoid having to recompile the entire project I thought I could simply recompile the single . file I modified into a .class and replace the original with it.

However, after repackaging the jar, the program does start but the functionality making use of the code I modified behaves erratically.

In the log I find:

<pre><code>E EventDispatchThreadExceptionHandler:Unhandled exception occurred during event dispatching.::
.util.MissingResourceException: Can't find bundle for base name com.myCompany.mySoftware.resources.ModuleResources, locale en_US
       at .util.ResourceBundle.throwMissingResourceException(ResourceBundle.:842)
</code></pre>

ModuleResources. is the file I modified...

<strong>Analysis of the problem:</strong>

<ol>
<li>Repackageing is not at fault: if I extract and repackage the original jar, everything works.</li>
<li>My modification does equally not seem to be the problem: when I recompile the JD-decompiled  file and use the resulting class file for repackaging, I get the same failure.</li>
</ol>

I decompiled the repackaged jar file and compared it with the decompilation of the original jar file: In the file I modified (at least) the code seems to be identical BUT JD shows different line numbers. Could that hint at the problem?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks!

1656,33757280,"I have a TextField in FX where the background color changes accordingly to if the content is valid or not.

Valid:

<pre><code>987654321 1

1701 91 1 2
4101 917 1 0 43

Invalid:

<pre><code>0101 9 1 0 1 0
3124
0314 9
</code></pre>

Basically: 

<ul>
<li>Only digits</li>
<li>First group 4 or 9 digits</li>
<li>If first group 9 digits -> only two groups in total</li>
<li>If first group 4 digits -> three, four or five groups in total</li>
<li>Group two and three digits 1-9999</li>
<li>Group four and five digits 0-9999</li>
</ul>

Now think one of these (valid) lines as one ""Ident"".

The current regex is: 

<pre><code>final String base = ""(\\d+\\s+\\d+)|(\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+(\\s+\\d+)?(\\s+\\d+)?)|(\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+)|(\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+)|(\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+\\s+\\d+)"";
</code></pre>

Wich works great so far, but now I want to include csv. So I can type only one ident as I have used to, or multiple idents separated by comma (,), but not more than five idents in total. 

My attempt: 

<pre><code>final String pattern = String.format(""(%s,?\\s*){1,5}"",base);
</code></pre>

This enables me to input this:

<ul>
<li>All the valid lines above</li>
<li>0101 9 1, 0101 9 2, 0101 9 3</li>
<li>0101 9 1, 987654321 21, 0101 9 3, 0101 9 4</li>
</ul>

And if I input more than 5 idents it turns invalid correctly.
But if I input the invalid ident 0101 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 it still turns valid.

Any suggestions? :)

1658,30187510,"I need to implements various <code>update</code> methods for <code>Observers</code> in my project, to overload the Object argument with a specific type. So instead of using

<pre><code>public void update (Observable o, Object arg0){
   if(arg0 instanceof Class1) ....
   else if (arg0 instanceof Class2) ....
</code></pre>

or a switch (which is a very 'C' way of working), I thought of using an <code>interface</code> that <strong>extends</strong> <code>Observer</code> and overloads the <code>update</code> method, like this

<pre><code>public interface ExtendedObserver extends Observer{
   public void update (Observable obj, Class1 cls);
   public void update (Observable obj, Class2 cls);
}
</code></pre>

and then implement it into my Observers. Every different Observer will use a specific update method.

I wanted to know if it's a correct way of working, because 

<ol>
<li>I don't think overloading a method inside an interface is correct</li>
<li>I still have to add the <em>unused</em> update methods inside every class that implements the interface.</li>

1672,12746740,"I have a problem with Spring: I need to reuse the same instance of bean twice, but not making it singleton.

Here is a brief ApplicationContext:

<pre><code>&lt;bean class=""a.b.c.Provider"" id=""defaultProvider"" scope=""prototype""&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=""lifecycle"" /&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=""propertySetter"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;

&lt;bean name=""lifecycle"" class=""a.b.c.Lifecycle"" scope=""prototype""&gt;
        &lt;constructor-arg ref=""someParam"" /&gt;

&lt;bean id=""propertySetter"" class=""a.b.c.PropertySetter"" scope=""prototype""&gt;
    &lt;constructor-arg ref=""lifecycle"" /&gt;
&lt;/bean&gt;
</code></pre>

So, I need to have fully initialized <code>Provider</code> with <code>Lifecycle</code> and <code>PropertySetter</code> inside,
and this <code>PropertySetter</code> must contain reference to same <code>Lifecycle</code>, as the <code>Provider</code> have.

When I define <code>lifecycle</code> and <code>propertySetter</code> as singletons, it causes big problems, because
if I create more than one <code>Provider</code>, all instances of <code>Provider</code> class shares same lifecycle
and property setter, and it's breaking application logic.

When I try to define all beans as prototypes, Lifecycles in <code>Provider</code> and in <code>PropertySetter</code> are not the same => exceptions again.

I have one solution: to pass to <code>Provider</code> only <code>Lifecycle</code> and create <code>PropertySetter</code> inside <code>Provider</code>  constructor (by extending <code>Provider</code>).
It is working well, but only in my local environment. In production code I can't extend 3pty <code>Provider</code> class, so I can't use this solution.

Please advise me, what most appropriate to do in this situation?

1676,12881170,"Specifically, this question is about Java and blktrace, but it can be generalized as following:

There is a command line application (blktrace) that can be called with parameters (specifically, format) or without. When called in default mode, this application returns one parameter that I need (starting block):

<pre><code>blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -

  8,0    0      144     0.011134344   524  I   W 819422 + 8 [kjournald]
</code></pre>

But not another (IO size). I can add parameters (-f) to specify the latter parameter:

<pre><code>blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -f ""%D %2c %8s %5T.%9t %5p %2a %3d %N\n"" -i -

  8,0    0      237     2.013031115   524  I   W 4096
</code></pre>

But doing so means I lose the former. The application is called from within a Java program.

I can't get both parameters from the application simultaneously. I can't run two instances of the application at the same time. I could run one instance after another, but that would mean my data isn't all compiled for the same IO sets.

Any idea how I could get both parameters for the same read/write operations?

1677,16514370,"I have recently been moving through a couple of books in order to teach myself Java and have, fortunately, mostly due to luck, encountered very few difficulties. That has just changed.

I read a section on the following under inheritance and the whole superclass subclass setup

-- When a new superclass object is created, it is, like all objects, assigned a reference (superReference in this example)

-- If a new subclass object (with the defining subclass extending the superclass) is created, and then the superReference reference is set to refer to that instead of the original object, it is my understanding that, since the reference is made for a superclass, only members defined by the superclass may be accessed from the subclass.

First - is this correct?

Second: If I am overriding a method and therefore have one in the super and one in the sub, and I create a superclass object and then assign its reference, as I did above, to a subclass object, by the principle called something like Dynamic Method Dispatch, a called overridden method should default to accessing the subclass method right?

Well, my question is:

If a reference to a superclass-object is retooled for a subclass-object and will deny direct object.member access to subclass-defined members, only supporting superclass-defined members, how can, if a superclass reference is retooled for a subclass object, an overridden method apply to the subclass-object if access is limited by the superclass-originated-reference-

<a href=""http://localhost:8080/gateway047/jolokia/exec/org.apache.camel:context=VCM047,type=routes,name=%22VCM047_store_list_schedule%22/stop()"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:8080/gateway047/jolokia/exec/org.apache.camel:context=VCM047,type=routes,name=%22VCM047_store_list_schedule%22/stop()</a>

But this never returns.

Can anyone offer some advice on how to stop / start a camel-section via Jolokia.

1710,2625600,"I have several Java classes with double fields that I am persisting via Hibernate.  For example, I have

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Node ...

  private double value;

When Hibernate's <code>org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect</code> creates the DDL for the Node table, it maps the value field to a ""double precision"" type.

<pre><code>create table MDB.Node (... value double precision not null, ...

It would appear that in Oracle, ""double precision"" is an alias for ""float"".  So, when I try to verify the database schema using the <code>org.hibernate.cfg.AnnotationConfiguration.validateSchema()</code> method, Oracle appears to describe the value column as a ""float"". This causes Hibernate to throw the following Exception 

<pre><code>org.hibernate.HibernateException: Wrong column type in DBO.ACL_RULE for column value. Found: float, expected: double precision

Which I could resolve by adding explicitly the MAVEN_OPTS parameters to the Maven goal within eclipse. But this doesn't solve my Eclipse project showing as having errors by (I assume) a Maven plugin in Eclipse.

Could someone please help me fix this problem as I would like to have Eclipse showing without any errors.

1719,4100800,"I just finished the main part of the current data structures project, and am working on collecting the statistics.  One requirement is that a count of all the references within the TreeMap be recorded.

This Map contains a 31,000+ nodes where a String is mapped to a TreeSet of indeterminate size.
I need to traverse the map and keep a running count of the number of items in the set.

Originally my idea was this:

<pre><code>Set&lt;String&gt; keySet= lyricWords.keySet();  
Iterator&lt;String&gt; iter= keySet.iterator();
String current= iter.next();

while (iter.hasNext){
  runCount+= lyricWords.get(current).size();
}
</code></pre>

The runtime for this is far too long to be acceptable.  Is there a more efficient way to do this on the final structure?  I could keep a count as the map is built, but the professor wants the numbers to be based on the final structure itself.

1735,27890750,"I have equipment that is <em>non SNMP-enabled</em>. I have the API to get its status and am implementing an SNMP agent for it. I did that with SNMP4j and can answer GET requests and send traps.

The problem I have is that there are several (2) such equipments to monitor with the <em>same</em> instance of my program. So far, I added a branch for each equipment in the MIB like <code>1.3.6.1.4.1.PEN.devices.1.xxx</code> and <code>1.3.6.1.4.1.PEN.devices.2.xxx</code> but 1-that's ugly and 2-I can't give a MIB usable for each equipment but a single MIB for the whole System with redundant information and that's also ugly ;)

I'm not sure if the MIB <code>Table</code> object is suitable for that, but it doesn't sound like the way to go (I have a fixed number of equipment). I also saw that <a href=""https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3413#section-3.5"" rel=""nofollow"">RFC 3413 Â§3.5</a> describes SNMP proxy forwarder but I'm not sure it is what I need to implement (my equipments are not SNMP-enabled), and SNMP4j <a href=""http://www.snmp4j.org/agent/doc/org/snmp4j/agent/ProxyForwarder.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>ProxyForwarder</code></a> seems to map a MIB to another MIB.

With SNMP4j, I implemented the <a href=""http://www.snmp4j.org/doc/org/snmp4j/CommandResponder.html#processPdu(org.snmp4j.CommandResponderEvent)"" rel=""nofollow""><code>processPDU()</code></a> method of the <code>CommandResponder</code> interface and I was hoping that, if the Supervision software is configured to use my program as a ""proxy forwarder"", there could be some information available in the <a href=""http://www.snmp4j.org/doc/org/snmp4j/CommandResponderEvent.html"" rel=""nofollow""><code>CommandResponderEvent</code></a> for me to send the correct response PDU (though I didn't find any such thing, I might have missed something).

I could start several instances of my agent (one per equipment) but I'd rather not for sparse ressources reasons.
What would be the best way to tackle that problem? Table? Proxy? Other? Not possible?

<strong>EDIT:</strong>

I have found that some NNM add an extra Variable Binding in the GET request to indicate which equipment to address (SNMP-proxy-like), while some other map the equipment by changing the community in the GET. Are these viable options? Which one is the most common/acceptable?

1744,6038590,"I've run into a very strange problem in Eclipse, and I'm not sure if its a bug or if some settings are just wrong.

I'm using Fedora Eclipse on Fedora 14.

I first noticed this issue when opening a file with null characters in the eclipse text editor. After the first null character was reached, no further characters were displayed. Furthermore, if the file contained a new line after the null everything between the null and newline was not displayed, but resumed properly after the newline.

Example:

<pre><code>#A file with values: 
66 6F 6F 00 62 61 72

#Displays:
foo

#When it should read something like:
fooNULLbar
</code></pre>

This wouldn't be more than a minor annoyance if it didn't extend to I/O when running a program in Eclipse. If I try to read the file in the previous example with an InputStream or Reader, it results in an end of file just before the null.

Example:

<pre><code># File: test
66 6F 6F 00 62 61 72

# File: Test.
import .io.File;
import .io.FileInputStream;

public class Test {
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
        try {
            File file = new File( ""test"" );

            FileInputStream in = new FileInputStream( file );

            int b;
            while ( ( b = in.read() ) != -1 ) {
            System.out.print( (char) b );
            }

            in.close();
        } catch ( Exception e ) {
            System.err.println( e.getMessage() );
        }
    }
}

# Produces output to Eclipse console:
foo

# While when run from command line, it produces:
fooNULLbar
</code></pre>

When I open these files or run these programs outside of Eclipse, everything works correctly including programs compiled in Eclipse.

I came across this while Googling the issue, but I'm not sure if it's the same issue: <a href=""https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283231"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=283231</a>

it is actually possible, since i've seen it in an actual working (not yet published) app. so - how do i do this?

1763,21097230,"Are there any advantages/disadvantages to passing class variables as arguments to a private method versus simply referencing them? As my classes grow longer and longer I worry about future coders needing to scroll up to the top of the class to figure out what ""foo"" is so I'm considering passing them as arguments when the method is called, but I'm not sure if that will cause other problems I'm not considering.

In short; is this:

<pre><code>public class Foo {

    private int number = 0;

    public Foo(int startingNumber) {
        this.number = startingNumber;
    }

    public int biggerNumber() {
        return embiggenIt(number);
    }

    // ... Many lines of code ...

    private int embiggenIt(int aNumber) {
        return aNumber++;
    }
}
</code></pre>

Any better or worse than this:

<pre><code>public class Foo {

    private int number = 0;

    public Foo(int startingNumber) {
        this.number = startingNumber;
    }

    public int biggerNumber() {
        return embiggenIt();
    }

    // ... Many lines of code ...

    private int embiggenIt() {
        return this.number++;
    }
}
</code></pre>

... and if so, why?

<strong>EDIT</strong>

Okay so apparently I should specify here that I don't care about changing the class variable, I'm not sure why everyone jumped to that conclusion; I didn't realize my example was that terrible (although I did slap it together in a hurry). In the example all I care about is the return value after I run the method (think functional programming).

Perhaps this is a better example of what I'm talking about:

<pre><code>public class Foo {

    private static final int number = 0;

    public Foo() {
    }

    public int biggerNumber() {
        return embiggenIt(number);
    }

    // ... Many lines of code ...

    private int embiggenIt(int aNumber) {
        return aNumber +1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

v.s.

<pre><code>public class Foo {

    private static final int number = 0;

    public Foo() {
    }

    public int biggerNumber() {
        return embiggenIt();
    }

    // ... Many lines of code ...

    private int embiggenIt() {
        return this.number +1;
    }
}
</code></pre>

I will stress that the variable does not have to be constant, but I added that just to make it clear that I'm not interested in altering the variable (I understand passing by reference vs passing by value, thanks).

Now that we're a bit more clear, does either approach make a difference? Which would you rather read? Which would make you smack the Jr. programmer's knuckles?

1776,21592430,"So I have this really weird problem that I simply cannot understand why it doesn't work. I am building a strobe light as part of my app and have created a separate Strobelight class. When I call the turnOn method or update method, the intervals never are changed. I guess it would make it easier to explain using some code:

<pre><code>public class Strobelight{

private int delayOn, delayOff;

public void turnStrobeOn(){...}

public void update(int a_delayOn, int a_delayOff){
    delayOn = a_delayOn;
    delayOff = a_delayOff;
}

public void turnOn(int a_delayOn, int a_delayOff){
    delayOn = a_delayOn;
    delayOff = a_delayOff;
    this.turnStrobeOn();
}
</code></pre>

Depending on whether the strobe light is already on or not, one of these methods are called to change turn on the strobe light with the specified intervals or simply to change the intervals.

Instead of changing the intervals to something custom, the application just uses the smallest possible intervals when calling Thread.sleep() for the flashlight being on or off

EDIT: this is the thread code, and code that turns the flashlight on

        p.setFlashMode(Parameters.FLASH_MODE_TORCH);
        cam.setParameters(p);

1779,27481140,"I have an Android app which relies on some webservices. The code used by both the Android app and the server component is factored out into a separate project, from which I generate a Jar which is used by the two components.

Now, to localize that shared part of the code, I'd like to use Java's ResourceBundle (obviously, I can't use Android ressources on the server). However, this does not yet work as intended: German umlauts (i.e., the Ã¤ - I haven't tried other umlauts yet) appear as (two different flavors of) question marks.

I've so far tried two different approaches:

<pre><code>public static String getString(String key, Locale locale) {
    return ResourceBundle.getBundle(STRINGS, locale).getString(key);
}
</code></pre>

and

<pre><code>public static String getString(String key, Locale locale) {

    } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) {
         throw new RuntimeException(e);
    }
}

The former results in question marks within a diamond, the latter in plain question marks.

Eclipse tells me that the properties files are encoded in ISO8859-1 (foo.properties -> Properties -> Resource says ""determined from content type: ISO8859-1"").

1781,8582760,"I have a customized GWT Date -Time widget which is a combination of two text boxes, one to hold the date and one to hold time. When I enter the date 04/09/1956 12:00 AM (in the Date widget), internally in the ValueChangeHandler for my widget I run it through the GWT's DateTimeFormat class' format() method which takes in the date and time zone information and gives me a formatted Date String that is User friendly when displayed and then based on the date in that widget, I set the time in the Time part of it.

The issue is when I put in dates not too old (my observation was dates not older than those in the year 1981), there seems to be no problem at all. When I put in dates older than that say 1956 in my case, there is some weird Daylight savings logic that messes my format of my string  by adjusting it back by 1 hour and gives me 04/08/1956 11:00 PM instead of 04/09/1956 12:00 AM. Even though the date object still represents the date I intended to, the formatted string is messed up with a different date representation.

This is issue is reproducible only when I run the app in production mode. When I run it locally on my machine in the hosted mode, I do not see this problem at all. That is the worst part.

I understand that GWT reads from a script file called noCache.js when we run in production mode as opposed to the Web-INF/lib folder in hosted mode.

Also, I run the .util.Date object through GWT's formatter in several other places where I have a date in hand but never have this issue..... It comes when I run it in a ValueChangeHandler.

Did any one encounter this weird behavior before?

OK. Here is the sample code:

<pre><code>Date date = new Date();
date.setYear(1956 - 1900);
date.setMonth(3);
date.setDate(9);
date.setHours(0);
date.setMinutes(0);
date.setSeconds(0);

// date here is 04/09/1956 12:00 AM

DateTimeFormat dateTimeFormat = new DateTimeFormat(somePattern); //pattern is a string       //which represents which pattern you want to use

String formattedDateString = dateTimeFormat.format(date, timeZone); // timeZone is an  //instance of com.google.gwt.i18n.client.TimeZone

// formattedDateString is 04/8/1956 11:00 PM. The time got pushed back by one hour.

As you can see, I'm using PDFBox (version 1.8.7). I've done some searching on this, but I wasn't able to find anything useful. I did find this JIRA issue, however: <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-490"" rel=""nofollow"">https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PDFBOX-490</a>

It seems maybe something was done in version 2.0, which was released this year (2016). At one point, I tried updating to the latest version, but there were so many changes, that I opted not to.

Is updating my only option? Is there anything I can do in 1.8.7?

Thanks!

Here's my code :

My ""cron"" task :

                CheckWebsite task = new CheckWebsite(website);
                executor.execute(task);
            }

            // This will make the executor accept no new threads
            // and finish all existing threads in the queue
            executor.shutdown();
        }
    },
    Akka.system().dispatcher()
);

My CheckWebsite class :

<pre><code>public class CheckWebsite implements Runnable {
    private Website website;

    public CheckWebsite(Website website) {
        this.website = website;
    }

    @Override

            Logger.info(e.getMessage());
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

My <code>checkState()</code> method in <code>Website.class</code> :

<pre><code>public WebsiteLog checkState() {
    // Since I use Socket and the connection can hang indefinitely, I use an other ExecutorService in order to limit the time spent
    // The duration is defined via Connector.timeout, Which will be the next code.

    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);

    Connector connector = new Connector(this);
    try {
        final long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        Future&lt;String&gt; future = executor.submit(connector);
        String response = future.get(Connector.timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

        long duration = System.nanoTime() - startTime;

        return PlatformLog.getLastOccurence(this, response, ((int) duration/ 1000000));
    }
    catch (Exception e) {
        return PlatformLog.getLastOccurence(this, null, null);

    }

    @Override

        Logger.info (""Connecting to "" + website.getAddress() + "":"" + website.getPort());
        Socket socket = new Socket();

        try {
            socket.connect(new InetSocketAddress(website.getIp(), website.getPort()), (timeout - 50));
            BufferedReader input = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(socket.getInputStream()));
            String response = input.readLine();
            socket.close();

            return response;
        }
        catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            throw e;
        }
        finally {
            // I take the precaution to close the socket here in order to avoid a memory leak
            // But if the previous ExecutorService force the close of this thread before
            // I can't guarantee it will be closed :/
            if (socket != null &amp;&amp; !socket.isClosed()) {

            }
        }
    }
}

I'm new to Java multithreading so I probably made big mistake. I suspect some area that could be potentially the reason, but my lack of knowledge requires me to ask for your help :)

As a summary, here's the potentials areas :

<ol>
<li>Creating a new <code>ExecutorService</code> every 5 minutes. Maybe I can reuse the old one ? Or do I need to close the current one when finished (if so, how ?).</li>
<li>The fact that I create an <code>ExecutorService</code> that will create an <code>ExecutorService</code> (in the <code>checkstate()</code> method) </li>
<li>The fact that the Connector class can be (violently) stopped by the <code>ExecutorService</code> running it, if it takes too long, resulting in a socket not closed (and then a memory leak) ?</li>
</ol>

Also, as you can see, the exception occured for the thread ""pool-535-thread-7"" which mean it didn't happen soon.

I store the last_occured check in the database, and the creation of the log entry (in <code>WebsiteLog</code>), the delta is around 5 hours (so, for every 5 minutes, the thread crashed after around 60 calls).

<strong>Update</strong> : Here's the revisited checkState method to include the shutdown call :

<pre><code>public PlatformLog checkState() {
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(1);

    Connector connector = new Connector(this);
    String response = null;
    Long duration = null;

    try {
        final long startTime = System.nanoTime();

        Future&lt;String&gt; future = executor.submit(connector);
        response = future.get(Connector.timeout, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

        duration = System.nanoTime() - startTime;
    }
    catch (Exception e) {}

    executor.shutdown();
    if (duration != null) {
        return WebsiteLog.getLastOccurence(this, response, (duration.intValue()/ 1000000));
    }
    else {
        return WebsiteLog.getLastOccurence(this, response, null);

1802,33179270,"Looked for over an hour and cannot seem to find a way to implement this.
I have a stringtokenizer object that is breaking apart a string(a mathematical expression). After reaching a certain point I want to be able to just take what is left of the string after the current position(I want to then use it recursively)

If I do 

<pre><code>StringTokenizer sTokenizer = new StringTokenizer(expression);
//operations with some of the tokens here
System.out.println(sTokenizer.nextToken());
</code></pre>

it will delimit by spaces.

I tried

<pre><code>sTokenizer.nextToken(null)
</code></pre>

but that just throws a null pointer exception.

I know I could just put some random string in the parameter that is unlikely to show up in the expression, but that isn't ideal.

If I were implementing this with substrings

<pre><code>expression.substring(currentposition)
</code></pre>

would work, but I need stringtokenizer.

In short, I'm trying to figure out a way to retrieve the remainder of a string(that is being used by stringtokenizer) as a single token.

1804,34081110,"I've read every topic about the issue and I got to know that to make the rest endpoint available without setting <code>@RequestParam</code> one needs to set in it <code>required=false</code>. I also got to know that there is a bug still available in version 4.1, and this parameter doesn't affect the behaviour of a controller, so <code>defaultValue</code> parameter should do the job.
And still neither works for me: I tried each of <code>defaultValue</code> and <code>required</code>, and both of them at the same time, and I even tried different order of them - I still get <code>Status 400 Bad Request</code> if I don't put those parameters in the get address.

1805,7434180,"I want to make a program that will make a pop-up appear at a certain time in the future, eg. 5:00 tonight. Basically, the program is a reminder/notification system for appointments, meetings, etc.

My first instinct was to create a sort of ""Clock Listener"" that would check the computer's time every minute or so and see if currentTime == alarmTime. However, I don't know if this takes up too much resources or if it is just a bad practice to have your program constantly doing things like that. Also, for the alarm to be accurate, I think it would need to check every second, rather than every minute (since if it isn't checking the seconds and will go off at 5:00:xx, it could go off at 5:00:59, which may be too late for some people's liking). Is checking the clock every second too much?

My second thought was when the program starts running, calculate how long it is until the alarm is set to go off (say, in five hours). Then, wait five hours, and then sound the alarm. But then I thought, though unlikely, it would be possible for the user to change the computer's time, and then the alarm would go off at the wrong time. So this doesn't really work.

I've seen some solutions that use threads, but I'm not familiar with those yet, so I'd rather not use them.

I'm leaning towards the first solution, but I want to make sure it's efficient and won't slow down other programs. Perhaps I'm overthinking it and checking the clock is a trivial operation, but I just wanted to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong.

A related question: assuming there is no such implementation, I'm surprised there isn't a library providing even a subset of SMB e.g. for simple file transfer. My intuition is that it wouldn't be massively difficult to implement a simple server (but of course would be very difficult to implement a complete solution like Samba). The fact that no one seems to have done it makes me suspicious that it is harder than I'd guess. Is there no implementation because it is difficult or because no one cares?

1815,18610510,"I have been in touch with the author of <a href=""https://github.com/mboudreau/Alternator"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Alternator"">Alternator</a> about this issue, and he's as puzzled as I am. The short story: I have written unit tests of code that operates against DynamoDB using the Alternator mocking framework that work fine when I invoke them from within Eclipse, but fail when invoked from maven. 

The failure arises from within the AWS SDK itself:

<pre><code>com.amazonaws.AmazonServiceException: [.lang.Error: property value is null.]

</code></pre>

which as you can see is not <em>hugely</em> useful as the stack trace itself is just showing the stack at the point where the AWS SDK is assembling an exception from the response received through the (mocked) remote service.

The relevant version numbers:

<ul>
<li>Maven 3.0.4</li>
<li>Java 1.7.0_10</li>
<li>AWS SDK 1.5.5 (although I've also tried 1.5.3 and 1.5.4)</li>
<li>Eclipse version ""Kepler"", Build id: 20130614-0229</li>
</ul>

The code under test is probably not particularly involved in this failure - I've done sufficient debugging tracing to see that it behaves identically during test when invoked directly through Eclipse, and when run from maven.

<strong>EDIT</strong>

Actually, Alternator <em>might</em> be implicated in this, as the error message in question could be coming out of  com.michelboudreau.alternator.validation.ValidatorUtils:

1820,32151520,"I am using <code>c</code> to compile a  program at the CentOS 7 terminal.  The program is very simple and is being used for some testing.  But it is throwing a <code>could not find or load main class</code> error as shown below.  How can I resolve this error?  

Here is the background:  

The  program is located in <code>/home/user/code/</code>, and the two jar files it uses as dependencies are in <code>/home/user/code/dependencies</code>.  The terminal commands and responses from trying to compile and run it are:  

<pre><code>[user@domain code]$ c -cp .:/home/user/code/dependencies/twilio--sdk-3.4.5.jar:/home/user/code/dependencies/httpcore-4.1.2.jar SendText.
[user@domain code]$  -cp .:/home/user/code/dependencies/twilio--sdk-3.4.5.jar:/home/user/code/dependencies/httpcore-4.1.2.jar mainpackage.SendText xxxxxxxxxx HelloThere
Error: Could not find or load main class name.of.package.SendText
</code></pre>

<strong>Is the problem with the compilation syntax, or with the calling syntax?</strong>  Note that <code>xxxxxxxxxx</code> and <code>HelloThere</code> are two <code>args</code> to be sent to the program when it is called. <code>xxxxxxxxxx</code> is the phone number to which a text will be sent, and <code>HelloThere</code> is the message.  (The code is tested and does send a text if compiled and run correctly.)

<code>SendText.</code> contains 6 imports as follows:  

<pre><code>import com.twilio.sdk.TwilioRestClient;
import com.twilio.sdk.TwilioRestException;
import com.twilio.sdk.resource.factory.MessageFactory;
import com.twilio.sdk.resource.instance.Message;
import org.apache.http.NameValuePair;
import org.apache.http.message.BasicNameValuePair;  
</code></pre>

I checked, and all of the 6 imports are located in the following two jars, which I also specified in the commands above:  

<pre><code>/home/user/code/dependencies/twilio--sdk-3.4.5.jar
/home/user/code/dependencies/httpcore-4.1.2.jar   
</code></pre>

Just to prove that there is a main method in <code>SendText.</code>, the results of <code>nano SendText.</code> are:

<pre><code>package name.of.package;

import com.twilio.sdk.TwilioRestClient;
import com.twilio.sdk.TwilioRestException;
import com.twilio.sdk.resource.factory.MessageFactory;
import com.twilio.sdk.resource.instance.Message;
import org.apache.http.NameValuePair;
import org.apache.http.message.BasicNameValuePair;

import .util.ArrayList;
import .util.List;

public class SendText {

  public static final String ACCOUNT_SID = ""arealsid"";
  public static final String AUTH_TOKEN = ""arealtoken"";

  public static void main(String[] args) throws TwilioRestException {
    TwilioRestClient client = new TwilioRestClient(ACCOUNT_SID, AUTH_TOKEN);
    String to = args[0];
    String body = args[1];
    // Build a filter for the MessageList
    List&lt;NameValuePair&gt; params = new ArrayList&lt;NameValuePair&gt;();
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""Body"", body));
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""To"", to));
    params.add(new BasicNameValuePair(""From"", ""+11234567654""));

    MessageFactory messageFactory = client.getAccount().getMessageFactory();
    Message message = messageFactory.create(params);

1821,28369660,"here is my problem. I'm trying to render a texture using LibGDX, with it's position and width relative to the screen size. Here's how I do it:

    Gdx.gl.glClear(GL20.GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    batch.begin();
    batch.draw(logo.getKeyFrame(frame), (Gdx.graphics.getWidth() / 2) - (logo.getKeyFrame(frame).getRegionWidth() / 2), Gdx.graphics.getHeight() - logo.getKeyFrame(frame).getRegionHeight());
    batch.end();

}

@Override
public void resize(int width, int height) {
    stage.getViewport().update(width, height, true);

The problem is, when I try to resize the window, the image doesn't get rendered where it should be. Is there any way to fix this?

I am particularly using the DemoGraphscene. in the one.demo4 package. While i am using am using the example in my fx project, I am not sure how to display the graph.

Here is what i have written in my controller class:

    Widget hello = scene.addNode (helloNodeID);
    Widget world = scene.addNode (worldNodeID);

    scene.addEdge (edge);

    scene.setEdgeSource(edge, helloNodeID);
    scene.setEdgeTarget(edge, worldNodeID);

    hello.setPreferredLocation (new Point (100, 100));
    world.setPreferredLocation (new Point (400, 200));

    pane1.getChildren().add(scene.getView());      

}

}

So i have  (argument mismatch; JComponent cannot be converted to Node) in the line pane1.getChildren().add(scene.getView());     

How do i come about this problem ?

I did this:

SwingNode swingScene = new SwingNode(); SwingNode swingScene1 = new SwingNode(); swingScene.setContent(new JButton(""Click me!"")); swingScene1.setContent(scene.getView()); pane1.getChildren().add(swingScene1); 

When I do pane1.getChildren().add(swingScene1), I see nothing is displayed, but pane1.getChildren().add(swingScene) does show the button.

<em>""handlers should not, in general, throw. If they do, the EventBus will catch and log the exception. This is rarely the right solution for error handling and should not be relied upon; it is intended solely to help find problems during development.""</em>

If you know that certain exceptions might occur you can register a SubscriberExceptionHandler with the EventBus and use it to handle these exceptions.

But what happens if an unhandled exception occurs? Normally, I would want an unhandled exception to ""bubble up"" the calling chain. When using a SubscriberExceptionHandler, I have access to the original exception that was thrown in the event handler, and I just want to rethrow it. But I could not figure out how.

So how can you make sure unexpected exceptions in event handlers are not ""swallowed"", regardless if a SubscriberExceptionHandler is used or not?

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

1835,27473990,"I'm trying to use elements of Google's <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/crawler-commons/"" rel=""nofollow"">Crawler Commons</a> package to help with my own project in Eclipse but I'm having difficulties getting it to work due to missing dependencies. I'm new to Maven so I'm having some trouble understanding where I'm going wrong. Here are the steps I've gone through so far:

So after downloading the files <a href=""https://code.google.com/p/crawler-commons/downloads/list"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, I added the crawler-commons-0.5.jar to my Eclipse project build path. When trying to use any of the classes, such as RobotUtils for example, the following error is raised:

<blockquote>
  Exception in thread ""main"" .lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/slf4j/LoggerFactory    at
  crawlercommons.robots.RobotUtils.(RobotUtils.:36)     at
  Main.Main.main(Main.:8) Caused by:

  .lang.ClassLoader.loadClass(ClassLoader.:357)     ... 2 more
</blockquote>

So I downloaded the pom.xml for this project <a href=""http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.google.code.crawler-commons%22"" rel=""nofollow"">from here</a> and dropped it into the root folder of where the Google Crawler Commons .jar is. I use the command <code>mvn</code> on it and it downloads some stuff and returns successfully. However, all it does is give me an additional folder called target with a couple of .jar files that have the correct name, but don't actually contain any of the classes I need.

So am I missing something here? How do I get mvn to grab the <code>org.slf4j.LoggerFactory</code> code I need here?

When I debug this line-by-line, it runs fine until it has unzipped all files, then it gets to <code>zis.closeEntry()</code>, and the debugger just ""goes away"", i.e. the next line (<code>Log.wtf(...)</code>) is never executed. My AsyncTask is never finished, it's just as if I'm stuck in an infinite loop?! But looking at the source for <code>ZipInputStream.closeEntry()</code> there doesn't seem to be any loops or anything suspicious there?

I have also tried extracting the ZIP archive using <code>ZipFile</code> instead of <code>ZipInputStream</code>, but then I get the following error:

<pre><code>.util.zip.ZipException: End Of Central Directory signature not found
</code></pre>

There is nothing wrong with the ZIP file, I have tested it with <code>zip -v -T</code> on Mac OSx. I have also tried re-zipping it using ZIP version 3.0 and 2.1 (original was 2.0). I can unzip all version without any problems on Mac OSx (using The Unarchiver and Archive Utility).

This is driving me nuts, what can possibly be wrong?

&nbsp;

<strong>Update (solved)</strong>

<em>Turns out to be a really stupid problem, not really related to the unzipping.</em>

<em>I'm downloading the ZIP files from a server before unzipping them, and apparently I forgot to call <code>close()</code> on the output stream from the download operation before starting the unzip operation.</em>

<em>Perhaps this thread can help someone else who makes the same stupid mistake.</em>

my question is about the getpath method, I don't think it is necessary, I think that  has a built in method to do that
getClass().getProtectionDomain().getCodeSource().getLocation().getPath())=""/C:/test%20test/""
it is converted to ""\C:\test test\"" so I can pass it to the fileOutputStream constructor
basically the getpath method changes the '\' to '/' and the %20 to ' '

Since SOAP-UI tests go hand-in-hand with both the actual API Java implementation, and its version, I was wondering what would be the best way to structure the SOAP-UI tests?

1) Should each set of SOAP-UI tests for a Java project be a SOAP-UI Project or a Test Suite?
2) Would it make sense to include the SOAP-UI tests inside each Java project in the same way we usually embed JUnit tests (in its own package)?

1845,20355720,"I have the following code:

<pre><code>when(mockedOperation.getResult(anyDouble(), anyDouble())).thenCallRealMethod();
when(mockedOperation.division(anyDouble(), not(eq(0d)))).thenCallRealMethod();
</code></pre>

Where <code>Operation</code> is something like <code>Command</code> pattern - it encapsulates some concrete action, in this case, simplified - division operation. The result retrieval happens not directly, but by the means of contract method, say <code>getResult(arg1, arg2)</code>. So, I call 

<pre><code>  mockedOperation.division(10d, 3d);
</code></pre>

But (from debugging info in my concrete implementation of <code>Operation</code>) I can see that <code>division()</code> gets not <code>10</code> and <code>3</code> but <code>(0, 0)</code>.

As far as I understand, that arguments are lost somewhere between the <code>thenCallRealMethod()</code> by <code>getResult()</code> and calling <em>real</em> <code>division()</code> afterwards.

What is the reason for that behavior and how should I implement partial mocks correctly in case I really need it?

UPD. Maybe I should try to say it another way, for example, simply how do you create mocks that <code>callRealMethod</code> in such a way that arguments are correctly delivered to the endpoint?

    DataSource source = new DataSource(Path);

The used arff file includes 780 instances. Each instance has 6 attributes {PT1, w1, d1, PT2, w2, d2} all numeric and a class {yes, no}.
My code is working and I can see the resulting Decision Tree using

<pre><code>System.out.println(tree.toString());
</code></pre>

Now, I want to create a new Instance (not using another arff file) and classify this new instance. Say the values for this new instance are, for example, {50, 5, 800, 74, 3, 760}. Then the Decision Tree must return the corresponding class (a ""yes"" or a ""no"").

In an ArrayList of Object you can add any Object... also you can add the same ArrayList with Objects into another ArrayList of Object. Why is this not working:

It works well enough and I can get it running at a steady 60 FPS, the only problem is it eats up so much CPU. On average it uses about 50% CPU and slows down the rest of my computer  - Minecraft uses about the same on my laptop! I know for a fact that the problem lies in the game loop in the code above.

So I'm just trying to understand what is causing this to happen. I did try to use a profiler but I still couldn't work out what was causing the problem.

How could I resolve this? There doesn't seem to be any known bugs of this and I just found non-answered threads in several forums. I also tried <code>EnumType.STRING</code> and leaving some of the annotations, without effect though :/<br>
<strong>EDIT:</strong>
I also tried to just use a raw <code>enum</code> with standard constructor and no fields, nothing but the values. So the error must not lie in my enum-pojo.<br>
<strong>EDIT2:</strong><br>
My problem lied a bit elsewhere. (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16433250/jsf-and-type-safety"">JSF and type safety</a>). However I will accept the answer how pushed me in the right direction :)

I tried all the annotations that are available (like @JoinColumn etc.) but not one combination of annotations worked. Maybe one of the mistakes is the fact, that I'm creating the foreign-key-column inside the many-table on my own??? I don't know...

<li>The map needs to be scrollable. Meaning clicks and drags need to be
registered.</li>
<li>The individual map tiles need to be clickable. When a tile is
clicked, I would like to know what tile it was. (Edit: I can currently register clicks on the actor but I would have to manually calculate what tile was actually clicked. Is there a better way for this?)</li>
<li>Then, the map needs to know what tile is being displayed in the top
left or right position to determine how many tiles to request from
the QuadTree and essentially what to draw on screen.</li>
<li>The map data is stored in a quadtree. In the end there is a method I
will have to call with what tiles I want to draw and the Quadtree
will return the tiledata to me.</li>
<li>And last but not least: Tiles that reach outside the map boundries
should be cropped (less priority)</li>

I can already draw the map actor on screen. It looks ugly as hell but what the heck. Not important now.
I think the most important thing for now would be to register clicks on tiles, figure out how many tiles to display/ request and maybe do something with the camera to make it scrollable?

1892,36785720,"So I am trying to learn Java, and have been writing a basic program based off of the <strong>21 matches</strong> game; in which each player takes turns taking 1,2 or 3 matches. The player to take the last match loses. 

It was going well until I found that when the user was about to win, the program wouldn't enter the final <code>else if</code> statement; it would skip over it and come back to the user, without the computer having taken any matches. Attached is the method I have written for the computers turn.

<pre><code>public static int ComputerPlays(int matches){ //Method for the computers turn
    int matchesTaken = 0;

    if (matches &gt; 7){ matchesTaken = new Random().nextInt(3)+1; }
    else if (matches &gt; 4 &amp;&amp; matches &lt; 8){ matchesTaken = matches - 4; }
    else if (matches &lt; 5){ matchesTaken = matches - 1; }
    else if (matches == 1){ matchesTaken = 1; }

    return(matches - matchesTaken);
}

The line <code>else if (matches == 1){ matchesTaken = 1; }</code> is where I'm having a problem. Any help would be appreciated.

P.S. I realize that I could turn the <code>else if</code> into an <code>else</code> statement, but the main thing is I want to learn what the problem is, not just get around it.

1893,29080840,"I'm generating some regexes dynamically and replacing the matched results with another string post-hoc in my application. I'm taking the start and end indices of a match then replacing each matched chunk of characters one by one and then adjusting the offsets for the next matches. However in one match out of other several successfully matched/replaced cases I noticed that my start and end indices include an extra character.

Here is the code I'm using to generate the regexes:

<pre><code>Pattern.compile(""[^a-zA-Z]+(?&lt;match&gt;"" + Pattern.quote(search[i]) + "")[^a-zA-Z]+"")
</code></pre>

Where in the case that's adding an extra character

<pre><code>search[i] = ""on a daily basis""
</code></pre>

The resulting regex

<pre><code>[^a-zA-Z]+(?&lt;match&gt;\Qon a daily basis\E)[^a-zA-Z]+
</code></pre>

This is the relevant text that's being matched against

<pre><code>to on a daily basis.
</code></pre>

My desired output is

<pre><code>on a daily basis
</code></pre>

This is the output I get from matcher.group(""match""), however when I debug the start() and end() results from the same matcher context I get 356 and 375 respectively (this is in the context of the full text), but you can see that the difference between those two numbers is 19 while the string ""on a daily basis"" is only 16 characters. 

I'm assuming that I need to account for the \Q and \E from Pattern.quote? But then where is the third extra additional character coming from? And why does this only occur in this pattern/target string case specifically?

Is there some other unrelated cause of the discrepancy that I'm overlooking?

1894,39858310,"Given new line (\n), tab (\t) and an escape character \ how can I given a string format it properly so it deals with these escape sequences and escape characters properly. Example 1:

<pre><code>""string \\t \t""
</code></pre>

The output would be:

<pre><code>""string \t    ""
</code></pre>

So in this case \\t is escaped to just \t and \t is formatted with a tab

Example 2:

<pre><code>""string \\t \n \\n""
</code></pre>

The output is:

<pre><code>""string \t
\n""
</code></pre>

I tried brute-forcing a solution but it didn't work as I am having problems delimiting tabs and spaces with a backslash infront.

<pre><code>String v= ""..."" //v for value
v = v.replace(""\\\"""",""\"""");
v = v.replace(""\\\\"",""\\"");
v = v.replace(""\\t"", ""  "");
v = v.replace(""\\n"", ""\n"");
v = v.replace(""\\\t"", ""\\t"");

1903,36479420,"I have an aggregator that is supposed to take all messages with a certain correlation key (in the example below I hardcoded this to 10, because the corresponding Splitter generates 10 messages).

I can see many messages via logging, and all 10 messages generated, but never 10 being received by the aggregator. Here is the code for the aggregator:

<pre><code>@MessageEndpoint
public class MyAggregator {     
   @ReleaseStrategy
   public boolean releaseStrategy( final List&lt; Map&lt; String, String &gt; &gt; msgs )
   {
       System.out.println( ""Aggregator.releaseStrategy:  received "" + msgs.size() + "" messages "" );

       if( msgs.size() == 10 ) {
           System.out.println( ""releasing the fragments!"" );
           return true;
       }           
       return false;
   }

   @CorrelationStrategy
   public String correlationStrategy( final Map&lt; String, String &gt; msg ) 
   {
       return msg.get( ""job.oid"" );
   }

   @Aggregator( inputChannel = ""input"", 
                outputChannel = ""output""  )
   public Map&lt; String, String &gt; aggregate( final List&lt; Map&lt; String, String &gt; &gt; msgs ) {

        System.out.println( ""received all fragments of a job! Number of fragments: "" + msgs.size() );

        Map&lt; String, String &gt; msg = new HashMap&lt; String, String &gt;();
        String jobOid = """";
        if( !msgs.isEmpty()) {
            jobOid = msgs.get( 0 ).get( ""job.oid"" );
        }
        msg.put( ""job.oid"", jobOid );
        msg.put( ""job.numberOfFragments"", """"+msgs.size() );
        return msg;
   }
}
</code></pre>

Could it be that multiple instances of the aggregator are consuming the messages, so that neither will receive all 10 belonging to one correlation group?

How can I fix this, since the aggregator I am writing is supposed to take ALL correlated messages and produce a new message from this.

1904,4523350,"I and some buddies have an argument here -  

in which langauge is it safer by terms of writing a code that cannot be hacked?

by hacked I mean that after the code is encrypted, or turned into executable ,  it can be reversed enginered into some kind of intermidate code (like  byte code) , or even the real high level program code itself .

This agruments aruse in general because one of us is about to start a big software project,but he's  afraid that his competitors will steal some of his very-efficient algorithams.

It would be nice if any of you could present some pros and cons for each langauge .

1906,3694790,"I have a class e.g. <code>MyDataClass</code>.
I have a <code>HashMap&lt;String,MyDataClass&gt; myMap;</code>
For each reference in the myMap, I also have some other MyDataClass references to the same object. To be specific:

<pre><code>MyDataClass c = new MyDataClass();
//configure c object with appropriate values
myMap.put(""akeyvalue"",c);
MyDataClass ref = c;

At this point ref and <code>myMap.get(""akeyvalue"")</code> refer to the same object in memory.
If I later do <code>myMap.remove(""akeyvalue"")</code> the entry in the hashmap will be removed, but the object <strong>ref</strong> will still refer to the same location. Essentially the value <code>myMap.get(""akeyvalue"")</code> still exists. How can I update it to null, so that it is synchronized to the hashmap? I.e. If I have distinct data structures/collections that refer to the same objects, what is the best pattern/design to use so as to keep them synchronized? In my small example, in the code that I do remove on <code>myMap</code>, I have no access to <strong>ref</strong> object. I must somehow find <strong>ref</strong> and null it. Generally, I could have a distict data structure e.g. <code>List&lt;MyDataClass&gt; refs;</code>

Now, in Class Process, the value of 't' in the for loop does not exceed beyond 2. I tried to debug the code but I am thrown out of the debug mode once t is equal to 2.

Please find attached a snaphot of the debug mode. <img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/lCdfL.png"" alt=""It says Thread main(Running) but in reality it is stuck at some value of t""> I have checked similar problems on stackoverflow and they recommended not using a global variable to loop through the for loop (i.e. use a local variable as an index) but I never used a global variable to index the for loop.

Apologies for sharing all the codes but I didn't wish to leave anything out.

It works fine, so I make a jar file of it which also works.
Now I created an <code>.exe</code> file of it by using <code>exe4j</code> and <code>lauch4j</code>. It will start but when I click on shutdown button nothing happens, <code>.exe</code> program does not work.
It irritates me, because no error message comes.

1911,17396800,"I'm currently trying to implement a Eclipse plugin to calculate some OO metrics for Java application, as DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree). However, i'm not being able to retrieve informations about a Class inheritance tree (distance between the class until Object). Assuming that a class is a CompilationUnit, I'm trying to getting into the class through the TypeDeclaration to compare if the class, for example, Dog (extends Animal) is a instance of Object. If not, it is done a recursive call to the visit method passing the Animal class as parameter, until the class is Object. 

<strong>EDIT</strong> I managed to recover the superclass using <code>typeDec.getSuperClassType()</code>, however I need to get the TypeDeclaration of this superclass to call the visit method recursively, passing this TypeDeclaration as parameter.

This is the idea of my code:

<pre><code>public class ClassVisitor extends ASTVisitor { 

 depthOfInheritanceTreeIndex = 1;

 public boolean visit(CompilationUnit unit) {
    for (Object type :unit.types()){

        TypeDeclaration typeDec = (TypeDeclaration) type;

        TypeDeclaration superClazz;
        if (superClassType.equals(Object.class.getSimpleName())){

        }else{
            depthOfInheritanceTreeIndex++;
            superClazz = (TypeDeclaration) superClassType.getParent();

<li>BookShop can be <code>NULL</code>;</li>
<li>method <code>BookShop.getBooks()</code> can return <code>NULL</code>;</li>
</ol>

Also, <code>getName()</code> can return <code>NULL</code> too.

So, general problem next: <strong>there is no guarantee the correctness of input parameter BookShop!</strong>

And I must to consider every possible option (3 <code>NULL</code>)

For me, add General <code>try-catch</code> block and that all.

Given a LinkedList with Integer values 

<pre><code>L1 = (2-&gt;1-&gt;4-&gt;6-&gt;3)
L2=  (1-&gt;9-&gt;6-&gt;3)
</code></pre>

The function should remove the Odd numbers from the linkedlist starting at the integer N and returns a reference to the new head

i.e 

<pre><code>L1.deleteOdd(2)  = &gt;  (2-&gt;4-&gt;6)

L2.deleteOdd(1)  = &gt;  (6)

I implemented a normal iterative function that does the job, here it is

<pre><code>public node deleteOdd(int n) {

    node head = this.head;

        return head;

            return head;
        }
        head = head.next;

    }
    return head;
}

My recursive function is 

<pre><code>public node DeleteOddR(int n) {

    if (head == null)
        return head;
    if (head != null) {
        if (head.data == n) {
            node head2 = head;
            if (head2.next.data % 2 != 0)

            {
                head2.next = head2.next.next;

            } else {

                head2 = head2.next;
            }

            if (head.data % 2 != 0) {
                return DeleteOddR(head.next.data);
            } else {
                head.next = DeleteOddR(head.next.data);

        } else {
            head = head.next;
        }

    }
    return head;
}
</code></pre>

The results is   

<pre><code>    node f = l1.DeleteOddR(2);
    display(f); // Gives-   &gt;2-&gt;3-&gt;4-&gt;6

1941,8605220,"I wrote a stock market simulator which uses a <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code> as a cache.

The cache holds about 75 elements but they are updated and retrieved very quickly (~ 500 times a second).

Here is what I did:

<strong>Thread 1:</strong>

Connected to an outside system which provides me with streaming quotes for a given stock symbol.

<strong>Thread 2 (callback thread):</strong>

Waits till data is delivered to it by the outside system. Once it gets the data, it parses it, creates an immutable DataEntry object, caches it and sends a signal to thread3.

<strong>Thread 3 (Consumer thread):</strong>
Upon receiving the signal, retrieve the DataEntry from the cache and uses it. (It is part of the task to not let thread2 push data directly to thread3).

<pre><code>public final class DataEntry{

      private final String field1;
      private final String field2;
      //...
      private final String field25;

      // Corresponding setters and getters

}

        }

        // Methods to update and retrieve DataEntry from the cache.
}
</code></pre>

After running it through a profiler, I noticed that I am creating a <em>lot</em> of <code>DataEntry</code> object. And therefore eden is filling up very quickly.

So, I am thinking of tweaking the design a bit by:

<strong>a)</strong> Making the <code>DataEntry</code> class mutable.

<strong>b)</strong> Pre-populating the cache with empty <code>DataEntry</code> objects.

<strong>c)</strong> When the update arrives, retrieve the <code>DataEntry</code> object from the map and populate the fields.

This way, number of <code>DataEntry</code> object will be constant and equal to the number of elements.

<strong>My questions are:</strong>

<strong>a)</strong> Does this design have any concurrency issues that I may have introduced by making the <code>DataEntry</code> mutable.

<strong>b)</strong> Is there anything else I can do to optimize the cache?

{
     // btnRefresh.setMnemonic(KeyEvent.VK_R); // Even if this line 
                                               // is not commented, but

     this.getRootPane().setDefaultButton(btnRefresh);
}

When it loads, the button is just selected, but it did nothing when the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key was being pressed. How do I correctly implement it?

1945,27349300,"I have successfully created a small program that will display the file system contents in a JTree. It shows only folders and plain text files by design. I would now like to add a folder to the tree when it is created. The example program will display the tree and create a folder, but it will not insert a new node for the folder that was just created. How can I insert a node into the tree when a folder is created and have the tree display the new folder?

1952,14981780,"I'm new to NoSQL, and I'm scratching my head trying to figure out the most appropriate NoSQL implementation for the application I'm trying to build.

My Java application needs to have an in-memory hashmap containing millions to billions of entries as it models a single-layer neural network. Right now we're using <a href=""http://trove.starlight-systems.com/"">Trove</a> in order to be able to use primitives as keys and values to reduce the size of the map and increase the access speed. The map is a map of maps where the outer map's keys are longs and the inner maps have long/float key/values. 

We need to be able to read the saved state from disk to the map of maps when the application starts up. The changes to the map of maps need also to be saved to disk either continuously or according to some scheduled interval. 

I was at first drawn towards <a href=""http://www.orientdb.org/"">OrientDB</a> because of their document and object DBs, although I'm still not sure at this point what would be better. Then I came across <a href=""http://redis.io/"">Redis</a>, which is a key value store and works with an in-memory dataset that can be dumped to disk, including master-slave replication. However, it doesn't look like the values of the map can be anything other than Strings. 

Am I looking in the right places for a solution to my needs? Right now, I like the in-memory and master-slave aspect of Redis, but I like the object/document capabilities of OrientDB as my data structures are more complicated than simple Strings and being able to use Trove with the primitive key/value types is very advantageous. It would be better if reading was cheap and writing was expensive rather than the other way around.

Just to repeat again My lock and unlock does happen successfully. Well unlock not successfully, cause after unlock there remains a busy cursor over my unlocked window. Its as good as gone. Useless.

I have seen from logs I am getting successfully out from unlock call. Then I don't know hat is causing that busy cursor to appear and block anything on my window.

I have got those logs too and they are pretty fine

I am not sure what is causing this then? 

Possible culprits and things I have tried

<ol>
<li>not doing invalidate in lock unlock</li>
<li>setting glasspane to null explicitly</li>
<li>not doing any listener stuff</li>
</ol>

All of these to no avail, situation remains bleak.

Anybody had experienced same, can give me pointers please? 

One constraint I have is I cant leave the glasspane method, to maintain homogeneity between application I have to use that. So I have to get this only working, no alternatives.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>

@trashgod I have taken the thread dump Unfortunately unable to attach it. What I need to look into that? Last three lines are                  ""VM Thread"" prio=10 tid=0x28688000 nid=0x5e58 runnable 

""VM Periodic Task Thread"" prio=10 tid=0x28721c00 nid=0x2bc0 waiting on condition 

JNI global references: 19887

Any help on this? What I should look at? ""VM Periodic Task Thread"" ?? some specific states which one?

How can I take help on the thread dump. I blv not through SO, crossing the char limit here.

I am trying to access one jsp through http url and i was expecting that it will redirect to https but i got an error in my firefox browser ie 

<blockquote>
  Firefox can't establish a connection to the server at 192.168.9.7:8443.
</blockquote>

Why it is looking for 8443 instead for port 8444.

Please help ??? 

Note : If i try to access the jsp from https url with 8444 port directly then i can access the same.

I am using tomcat 5.5.27

It is requested to throw some light on 

<blockquote>
  Connector port=""8009""
</blockquote>

this as well.What is the use of this 8009 port.

Ultimately, it would be ideal to override this, but it looks like I can't:

I want to do this so that when I release the app to my testers it doesn't become unresponsive.

1969,2927540,"I need help to generify and implement the visitor pattern.
We are using tons of <code>instanceof</code> and it is a pain. I am sure it can be modified, but I am not sure how to do it.

Basically we have an interface <code>ProcessData</code>

<pre><code>public interface ProcessData {
  public setDelegate(Object delegate);
  public Object getDelegate();
  //I am sure these delegate methods can use generics somehow
}
</code></pre>

Now we have a class <code>ProcessDataGeneric</code> that implements <code>ProcessData</code>

<pre><code>public class ProcessDataGeneric implements ProcessData {
  private Object delegate;

  public ProcessDataGeneric(Object delegate) {
    this.delegate = delegate;
  }
}
</code></pre>

Now a new interface that retrieves the ProcessData

<pre><code>interface ProcessDataWrapper {
  public ProcessData unwrap();
}
</code></pre>

Now a common abstract class that implements the wrapper so ProcessData can be retrieved

<pre><code>@XmlSeeAlso( { ProcessDataMotorferdsel.class,ProcessDataTilskudd.class })
public abstract class ProcessDataCommon implements ProcessDataWrapper {
  protected ProcessData unwrapped;

  public ProcessData unwrap() {
    return unwrapped;
  }
}
</code></pre>

Now the implementation

<pre><code>public class ProcessDataMotorferdsel extends ProcessDataCommon {

  public ProcessDataMotorferdsel() {
    unwrapped = new ProcessDataGeneric(this);
  }
}
</code></pre>

similarly

<pre><code>public class ProcessDataTilskudd extends ProcessDataCommon {

  public ProcessDataTilskudd() {
    unwrapped = new ProcessDataGeneric(this);
  }
}
</code></pre>

Now when I use these classes, I always need to do <code>instanceof</code>

<pre><code>ProcessDataCommon pdc = null;
if(processData.getDelegate() instanceof ProcessDataMotorferdsel) {
   pdc = (ProcessDataMotorferdsel) processData.getDelegate();
} else if(processData.getDelegate() instanceof ProcessDataTilskudd) {
   pdc = (ProcessDataTilskudd) processData.getDelegate();
}
</code></pre>

I know there is a better way to do this, but I have no idea how I can utilize Generics and the Visitor Pattern.
Any help is GREATLY appreciated.

<strong>UPDATE</strong>

I want to add that these classes are just snippets of a much larger implementation.
The <code>ProcessData</code> and <code>ProcessDataGeneric</code> is something that is outside of the delegates (<code>ProcessDataMotorferdsel</code> and so on). The delegates all extends <code>ProcessDataCommon</code>.

I can agree that a refactoring is probably best to do, but this is production code that is 2 years old, and it is costly to refactor (time,testing, etc). However, I am willing to do it.

<strong>UPDATE #2</strong>

I have tried to start the Generic process, however I am getting compile error. This is how it looks now.

<pre><code>public interface ProcessData&lt;T extends ProcessDataCommon&gt; {
  T getDelegate();
  setDelegate(T delegate);
}

public class ProcessDataGeneric&lt;T extends ProcessDataCommon&gt; implements ProcessData&lt;T&gt; {
  private T delegate;
  //Getter &amp; setter
  public ProcessDataGeneric(T delegate) {
    this.delegate = delegate;
  }
}

public class ProcessDataMotorferdsel extends ProcessDataCommon {
  public ProcessDataMotorferdsel() {
    unwrapped = new ProcessDataGeneric&lt;ProcessDataMotorferdsel&gt;(this);
  }
}
</code></pre>

I get compile error on line: <code>unwrapped = new ProcessDataGeneric&lt;ProcessDataMotorferdsel&gt;(this);</code> Saying 

<code>[c] ProcessDataMotorferdsel.:52: incompatible types
    [c] found   : ProcessDataGeneric&lt;ProcessDataMotorferdsel&gt;
    [c] required: ProcessData&lt;ProcessDataCommon&gt;
    [c]</code>

I cannot make heads or tails of that error message. The ProcessDataMotorferdsel class extends ProcessDataCommon, so IMO it should work.

Really do not know what is Happening... This is the method I used to put my Sharebutton:

<pre><code>public void setupFacebookShareIntent(String title, String summary, String url) {
        ShareButton shareButton = (ShareButton)findViewById(R.id.fb_share_button);

        ShareDialog shareDialog;
        FacebookSdk.sdkInitialize(getApplicationContext());
        shareDialog = new ShareDialog(this);

        ShareLinkContent content = new ShareLinkContent.Builder()
                .setContentUrl(Uri.parse(url))
                .build();
        shareButton.setShareContent(content);
        shareDialog.show(content);

    }
</code></pre>

I am not currently making use of the String ""title"" and ""summary"" until I am table to resolve this problem. 
I could post more code if you need to see. Would be great if you can help me get this thing up and running.

1974,15294630,"I tried to find a solution to this thing and I spent a lot of time, but it is almost imposible to me to do that.

The matter: I am using Selenium with Java in Firefox. I need to find an element (a listbox) and click on it. So, the code finds the element, but click action does not work. It works fine in Google Chrome every time, and just sometimes in Firefox (with the same Java code sometimes works, and sometimes does not).

<strong>There is the part of code with the element when the program enters on the page:</strong>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""size-btn"" class=""size-btn""&gt;
      &lt;span class=""selected-size""&gt;SELECCIONA TALLA &lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;div class=""size-select"" style=""display: none;""&gt;
        &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;tbody&gt;
            &lt;tr id=""selecsize_2"" class=""product-size"" data-ga-props=""{action:'Seleccionar_Producto', opt_label:'Escoger_Talla'}"" data-catentryid=""1051607""&gt;
            &lt;tr id=""selecsize_3"" class=""product-size"" data-ga-props=""{action:'Seleccionar_Producto', opt_label:'Escoger_Talla'}"" data-catentryid=""1051608""&gt;
            &lt;tr id=""selecsize_4"" class=""product-size"" data-ga-props=""{action:'Seleccionar_Producto', opt_label:'Escoger_Talla'}"" data-catentryid=""1051609""&gt;
            &lt;tr id=""selecsize_5"" class=""product-size"" data-ga-props=""{action:'Seleccionar_Producto', opt_label:'Escoger_Talla'}"" data-catentryid=""1051610""&gt;
          &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
      &lt;button class=""size-guide gaViewEvent gaTrack"" data-ga-props=""{action:'Seleccionar_Talla', opt_label:'Guia_de_tallas'}"" data-href=""http://www.anyweb.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductGuideSizeAjaxView?catalogId=24052&amp;categoryId=358056&amp;langId=-5&amp;productId=1047599&amp;storeId=10701""&gt;GuÃ­a de tallas&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<strong>And there is the part of code that changes when the element is clicked:</strong>

<pre><code>    &lt;div id=""size-btn"" class=""size-btn opened""&gt;
</code></pre>

I tried many solutions and sometimes it works, but the next time I run the program, it does not work again.

Some solutions:

<ol>
<li>It finds the element, but does not run click action. I checked with xpath and cssSelector, and there are unique elements found with those expressions.

<pre><code>driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//div[@id='size-btn' and not(contains(@class,'opened'))]/span"")).click(); // Also checked with By.cssSelector(""span.selected-size"")
</code></pre></li>
<li>I though it was because of the time, so I tried to solve it that way.

<pre><code>WebElement we = driver.findElement(By.xpath(""//div[@id='size-btn' and not(contains(@class,'opened'))]/span"")); // By.cssSelector(""span.selected-size"")
Thread.sleep(3000);
we.click();
</code></pre></li>
<li>Finally, I was a little bit desperate, and I created a new function to try to do this almost 60 times, looking for the change on the element code and if there was any change, just tried to do click action again.

<pre><code>clickAndWaitWhileElementIsNotPresent(By.xpath(""//div[@id='size-btn' and not(contains(@class,'opened'))]/span""),By.xpath(""//div[@class='size-btn opened']/span"")); // By.cssSelector(""span.selected-size"")

private void clickAndWaitWhileElementIsNotPresent(By by1, By by2) throws Exception {
    for (int second = 0;; second++) {
        if (second &gt;= 60)
            fail(""timeout"");
        try {
            if (isElementPresent(by2))
            {
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                driver.findElement(by1).click();
            }
        } catch (Exception e) {
        }
        Thread.sleep(1000);
    }
}
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

There are the images of the element:

When I click mouse, if lineci is true, it draws a line according to points. I get always last lines when I print elements of arraylist. If I draw 10 lines, 10 elements of the arraylist are the same. It never keeps old values inside arraylist. By the way boolean starter is not important. I just forget to remove it.

1979,27947450,"I am very new to JSF and still trying to run the basic application to understand how the things work.

<strong>I am using JBoss AS 7 and JSF 2.0(Mojarra 2.0.3-FCS)</strong>

First I created a normal Application which was used to print on the page

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" 
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""
    xmlns:ui=""http://.sun.com/jsf/facelets""
    xmlns:h=""http://.sun.com/jsf/html""
    xmlns:f=""http://.sun.com/jsf/core""&gt;

&lt;h:head&gt;
&lt;/h:head&gt;
&lt;h:body&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value=""Hello World""&gt;&lt;/h:outputLabel&gt;
&lt;/h:body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

It works and I can understand pretty much everything.

During the Deployment, it did give two warnings

<pre><code>21:19:06,193 WARN  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-8) JBAS015893: Encountered invalid class name 'com.sun.faces.vendor.Tomcat6InjectionProvider:org.apache.catalina.util.DefaultAnnotationProcessor' for service type 'com.sun.faces.spi.injectionprovider'
21:19:06,195 WARN  [org.jboss.as.server.deployment] (MSC service thread 1-8) JBAS015893: Encountered invalid class name 'com.sun.faces.vendor.Jetty6InjectionProvider:org.mortbay.jetty.plus.annotation.InjectionCollection' for service type 'com.sun.faces.spi.injectionprovider'
</code></pre>

But any how it worked(However it would be nice, if it would go away)

<hr>

<strong>The part where it started giving Problem.</strong>

Then, I tried using Managed Bean and it started creating problem

So I created a Bean

<pre><code>package org.demojsf.samples.beans;

import x.annotation.ManagedBean;
import x.enterprise.context.RequestScoped;

@ManagedBean ( value= ""greet"")
@RequestScoped
public  class GreetBean {
    public GreetBean(){

    }
    public String greet() {
        return ""Greeting""   ;   
    }

}
</code></pre>

<strong>Please note that I tried @ManagedBean(name=""greet"") but eclipse was treating it as an error and the fix that it provided was to change it to value. Hence value is there</strong>

<strong>The XHTML code is something like :</strong>

<pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC ""-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN"" 
    ""http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd""&gt;

&lt;html xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml""
    xmlns:ui=""http://.sun.com/jsf/facelets""
    xmlns:h=""http://.sun.com/jsf/html""
    xmlns:f=""http://.sun.com/jsf/core""&gt;

&lt;h:head&gt;
&lt;/h:head&gt;
&lt;h:body&gt;
    &lt;h:outputLabel value=""#{greet.greet()}""&gt;&lt;/h:outputLabel&gt;
&lt;/h:body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

and then it threw this error

It works super for about 100 clients.  At about 140+ I get a load of exceptions in the client - when it tries to connect. The exception is: .util.concurrent.ExecutionException: .io.IOException: The remote computer refused the network connection. 

My test is on a single laptop running windows 7. When it bombs out I check the TCP connections and there about 500 - 600 connections -that's ok. AS I have similiar JDK 1.0 .net socket programs that can handle 4,000 TCP connections.

No exceptions or anything dodgy looking in server.

So I am at a loss as to what could be wrong here. any ideas?

1985,6151690,"Hello 
I have a very simple client-server program that uses sockets simulating a simple atm.
In the client part of the program i have a gui class and another thread to communicate with the server so the gui and the logic are separated and also the gui is not freezing while waiting the thread to communicate with the server.

I create one thread since the clientsocket is created upon connection and lives through the entire session.And  the problem is that i have the thread looping in an endless loop and asking the gui if the user pressed any key so it can take care of the actions.

Any suggestions of best practises on this matter?
I don't want to use RMI since i 'am developing for educational reasons.

1991,6762570,"Basically, what I want to do is <strong>force</strong> the subclass to call an abstract superclass method (implemented in the subclass), so I don't have to explicitly write it each time I create a new subclass.

I wrote it in the superclass' constructor once, because I want it to force it for every implementation.

<pre><code>public abstract class SupahClass {
    public SupahClass() {
        doStuff(); // It IS executed when the subclass constructor is called
        init(); // NOT executed, even though it's implemented
    }

    private void doStuff() { ... }        

    protected abstract void init();
}

public class SomeSubClass extends SupahClass {

    // The problem lies HERE: this is executed AFTER init() ... so it gets NULL again
    private TextBox myTextBox = null;

    public SomeSubClass() {
        super(); // invokes the super constructor, so init() should be called
        // I could call init(); here EACH time i create a new subclass... but no :)
    }

    @Override
    public void init() {
        this.myTextBox = new TextBox(); // Executed BEFORE its declared as null above
    }
}
</code></pre>

Of course, the superclass can't really call it since its an abstract (so undefined) method, but its an ABSTRACT class so it cannot be instanciated, it must delegate the task to its subclasses, so why cant they call the abstract but now implemented method?

<strong>EDIT</strong> 
See the subclass property <code>myTextBox</code> and the <code>init()</code> implementation

Which approach do you think I should do? Remove the <code>= null</code> in the property declaration (duhhh)

or remove the <code>init()</code> in the superclass and explicitly calling it in the subclass constructor (this is what I wanted to avoid, since I will have to write it 100% of the time..)

I've used the tool at : <a href=""http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/</a> to check the port : 6600

Here is what it says :

It was running fine yesterday, but this morning I changed :

<pre><code>InetSocketAddress addr;   to   static InetSocketAddress addr;
HttpServer server;        to   static HttpServer server;
</code></pre>

When I ran it, I got the following error message : 

<pre><code>Server is listening on port : 6600

Then I realize if they are static, they might keep them selves in memory and occu the port, so I changed them back to non-static like the above code. But now when I run it, the error message keeps appearing, and in Netbeans there is a ""notification"" saying something like : ""package-info.class is in wrong place, delete it or put it in the right sub directory ..."" don't remember the exact wording. But when I open the url, the web page works fine as if there is no error message, and when I stop the server the page won't appear as it supposed to be.

So it seems like a Netbeans 8.0.2 malfunctioning, but I don't know how to make the error message not appear, or as it suggested how to delete ""package-info.class"" or put it into the correct sub dir, I can't even find where it is, how to fix it ?
